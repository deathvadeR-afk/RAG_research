# Research Assistant AI Agent: Comprehensive Project Blueprint

## Executive Summary

This blueprint outlines the development of a sophisticated Research Assistant AI Agent leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture. The system integrates multiple retrieval mechanisms—vector databases, knowledge graphs, relational databases, and keyword search—orchestrated through LangGraph and powered by Gemini 2.0 for natural language generation.

## Project Architecture Overview

### Core Philosophy
The system employs a **multi-modal retrieval strategy** where different retrieval methods complement each other to provide comprehensive, contextually rich information retrieval. This approach ensures both semantic understanding (vector search) and precise factual retrieval (structured queries).

```

**Query Optimization:**
- Pre-computed centrality metrics for influential nodes
- Indexed relationships for fast traversal

#### Relational Database Design (PostgreSQL)
**Core Tables:**
```sql
papers (id, title, abstract, full_text, arxiv_id, date_published, category, citation_count)
authors (id, name, email, affiliation, verified, h_index)
paper_authors (paper_id, author_id, position, corresponding)
citations (citing_paper_id, cited_paper_id, context_snippet, citation_type)
topics (id, name, description, parent_topic_id)
paper_topics (paper_id, topic_id, relevance_score)
```

**Performance Optimization:**
