In this paper, we present a method by which backtrack points can be moved deeper in the search space, thereby avoiding this difficulty. The technique developed is a variant of dependency-directed backtracking that uses only polynomial space while still providing useful control information and retaining the completeness guarantees provided by earlier approaches."

    "abstract": "Market price systems constitute a well-understood class of mechanisms that under certain conditions provide effective decentralization of decision making with minimal communication overhead. In a market-oriented programming approach to distributed problem solving, we derive the activities and resource allocations for a set of computational agents by computing the competitive equilibrium of an artificial economy. WALRAS provides basic constructs for defining computational market structures, and protocols for deriving their corresponding price equilibria. In a particular realization of this approach for a form of multicommodity flow problem, we see that careful construction of the decision process according to economic principles can lead to efficient distributed resource allocation, and that the behavior of the system can be meaningfully analyzed in economic terms."

    "abstract": "We describe an extensive study of search in GSAT, an approximation procedure for propositional satisfiability. GSAT performs greedy hill-climbing on the number of satisfied clauses in a truth assignment. Our experiments provide a more complete picture of GSAT's search than previous accounts. We describe in detail the two phases of search: rapid hill-climbing followed by a long plateau search. We demonstrate that when applied to randomly generated 3SAT problems, there is a very simple scaling with problem size for both the mean number of satisfied clauses and the mean branching rate. Our results allow us to make detailed numerical conjectures about the length of the hill-climbing phase, the average gradient of this phase, and to conjecture that both the average score and average branching rate decay exponentially during plateau search. We end by showing how these results can be used to direct future theoretical analysis. This work provides a case study of how computer experiments can be used to improve understanding of the theoretical properties of algorithms."

    "abstract": "As real logic programmers normally use cut (!), an effective learning procedure for logic programs should be able to deal with it. Because the cut predicate has only a procedural meaning, clauses containing cut cannot be learned using an extensional evaluation method, as is done in most learning systems. On the other hand, searching a space of possible programs (instead of a space of independent clauses) is unfeasible. An alternative solution is to generate first a candidate base program which covers the positive examples, and then make it consistent by inserting cut where appropriate. The problem of learning programs with cut has not been investigated before and this seems to be a natural and reasonable approach. We generalize this scheme and investigate the difficulties that arise. Some of the major shortcomings are actually caused, in general, by the need for intensional evaluation. As a conclusion, the analysis of this paper suggests, on precise and technical grounds, that learning cut is difficult, and current induction techniques should probably be restricted to purely declarative logic languages."

A performance system uses this learned information to generate completion strings and construct a user interface. Description of Online Appendix: People like to record information. Doing this on paper is initially efficient, but lacks flexibility. Recording information on a computer is less efficient but more powerful. In our new note taking softwre, the user records information directly on a computer. Behind the interface, an agent acts for the user. To help, it provides defaults and constructs a custom user interface. The demonstration is a QuickTime movie of the note taking agent in action. The file is a binhexed self-extracting archive.

We analyze from a theoretical point of view a TKRS whose capabilities go beyond the ones of presently available TKRSs. The new features studied, often required in practical applications, can be summarized in three main points. First, we consider a highly expressive terminological language, called ALCNR, including general complements of concepts, number restrictions and role conjunction. Second, we allow to express inclusion statements between general concepts, and terminological cycles as a particular case. Third, we prove the decidability of a number of desirable TKRS-deduction services (like satisfiability, subsumption and instance checking) through a sound, complete and terminating calculus for reasoning in ALCNR-knowledge bases. Our calculus extends the general technique of constraint systems. As a byproduct of the proof, we get also the result that inclusion statements in ALCNR can be simulated by terminological cycles, if descriptive semantics is adopted."

In addition to continuous feedback, T-R programs support parameter binding and recursion. A primary difference between T-R programs and many other circuit-based systems is that the circuitry of T-R programs is more compact; it is constructed at run time and thus does not have to anticipate all the contingencies that might arise over all possible runs. In addition, T-R programs are intuitive and easy to write and are written in a form that is compatible with automatic planning and learning methods. We briefly describe some experimental applications of T-R programs in the control of simulated and actual mobile robots."

Several artificial neural networks (ANNs) have been implemented, and a challenge for better symbolic models has been posed. In this paper, we present a general-purpose Symbolic Pattern Associator (SPA) based upon the decision-tree learning algorithm ID3. We conduct extensive head-to-head comparisons on the generalization ability between ANN models and the SPA under different representations. We conclude that the SPA generalizes the past tense of unseen verbs better than ANN models by a wide margin, and we offer insights as to why this should be the case. We also discuss a new default strategy for decision-tree learning algorithms."

We describe a new version of our SUBDUE substructure discovery system based on the minimum description length principle. The SUBDUE system discovers substructures that compress the original data and represent structural concepts in the data. By replacing previously-discovered substructures in the data, multiple passes of SUBDUE produce a hierarchical description of the structural regularities in the data. SUBDUE uses a computationally-bounded inexact graph match that identifies similar, but not identical, instances of a substructure and finds an approximate measure of closeness of two substructures when under computational constraints. In addition to the minimum description length principle, other background knowledge can be used by SUBDUE to guide the search towards more appropriate substructures. Experiments in a variety of domains demonstrate SUBDUE's ability to find substructures capable of compressing the original data and to discover structural concepts important to the domain. Description of Online Appendix: This is a compressed tar file containing the SUBDUE discovery system, written in C.

This allows us to measure the precise role of a clause or literal in allowing or preventing a (desired or undesired) derivation for a given example. This information is used to efficiently locate and repair flawed elements of the theory. PTR is proved to converge to a theory which correctly classifies all examples, and shown experimentally to be fast and accurate even for deep theories."

If we are reasoning about a world or system consisting of N individuals, then we can consider all possible worlds, or first-order models, with domain {1,...,N} that satisfy KB, and compute the fraction of them in which Phi is true. We define the degree of belief to be the asymptotic value of this fraction as N grows large. We show that when the vocabulary underlying Phi and KB uses constants and unary predicates only, we can naturally associate an entropy with each world. As N grows larger, there are many more worlds with higher entropy. Therefore, we can use a maximum-entropy computation to compute the degree of belief. This result is in a similar spirit to previous work in physics and artificial intelligence, but is far more general. Of equal interest to the result itself are the limitations on its scope. Most importantly, the restriction to unary predicates seems necessary. Although the random-worlds method makes sense in general, the connection to maximum entropy seems to disappear in the non-unary case. These observations suggest unexpected limitations to the applicability of maximum-entropy methods."

    "abstract": "Information extraction is the task of automatically picking up information of interest from an unconstrained text. Information of interest is usually extracted in two steps. First, sentence level processing locates relevant pieces of information scattered throughout the text; second, discourse processing merges coreferential information to generate the output. In the first step, pieces of information are locally identified without recognizing any relationships among them. A key word search or simple pattern search can achieve this purpose. The second step requires deeper knowledge in order to understand relationships among separately identified pieces of information. Previous information extraction systems focused on the first step, partly because they were not required to link up each piece of information with other pieces. To link the extracted pieces of information and map them onto a structured output format, complex discourse processing is essential. This paper reports on a Japanese information extraction system that merges information using a pattern matcher and discourse processor. Evaluation results show a high level of system performance which approaches human performance."

These graphical models are extended to model data analysis and empirical learning using the notation of plates. Graphical operations for simplifying and manipulating a problem are provided including decomposition, differentiation, and the manipulation of probability models from the exponential family. Two standard algorithm schemas for learning are reviewed in a graphical framework: Gibbs sampling and the expectation maximization algorithm. Using these operations and schemas, some popular algorithms can be synthesized from their graphical specification. This includes versions of linear regression, techniques for feed-forward networks, and learning Gaussian and discrete Bayesian networks from data. The paper concludes by sketching some implications for data analysis and summarizing how some popular algorithms fall within the framework presented. The main original contributions here are the decomposition techniques and the demonstration that graphical models provide a framework for understanding and developing complex learning algorithms."

We show that there are some subtle assumptions that underly the wide-spread intuitions regarding the supposed efficiency of partial-order planning. For instance, the superiority of partial-order planning can depend critically upon the search strategy and the structure of the search space. Understanding the underlying assumptions is crucial for constructing efficient planners."

The definition is acquired by studying collections of training examples of the form [x_i, f (x_i)]. Existing approaches to multiclass learning problems include direct application of multiclass algorithms such as the decision-tree algorithms C4.5 and CART, application of binary concept learning algorithms to learn individual binary functions for each of the k classes, and application of binary concept learning algorithms with distributed output representations. This paper compares these three approaches to a new technique in which error-correcting codes are employed as a distributed output representation. We show that these output representations improve the generalization performance of both C4.5 and backpropagation on a wide range of multiclass learning tasks. We also demonstrate that this approach is robust with respect to changes in the size of the training sample, the assignment of distributed representations to particular classes, and the application of overfitting avoidance techniques such as decision-tree pruning. Finally, we show that---like the other methods---the error-correcting code technique can provide reliable class probability estimates.

In this paper we provide a domain-independent algorithm for plan adaptation, demonstrate that it is sound, complete, and systematic, and compare it to other adaptation algorithms in the literature. Our approach is based on a view of planning as searching a graph of partial plans. Generative planning starts at the graph's root and moves from node to node using plan-refinement operators. In planning by adaptation, a library plan - an arbitrary node in the plan graph - is the starting point for the search, and the plan-adaptation algorithm can apply both the same refinement operators available to a generative planner and can also retract constraints and steps from the plan. Our algorithm's completeness ensures that the adaptation algorithm will eventually search the entire graph and its systematicity ensures that it will do so without redundantly searching any parts of the graph."

Currently the most important application of these methods is to temporal credit assignment in reinforcement learning. Well known reinforcement learning algorithms, such as AHC or Q-learning, may be viewed as instances of TD learning. This paper examines the issues of the efficient and general implementation of TD(lambda) for arbitrary lambda, for use with reinforcement learning algorithms optimizing the discounted sum of rewards. The traditional approach, based on eligibility traces, is argued to suffer from both inefficiency and lack of generality. The TTD (Truncated Temporal Differences) procedure is proposed as an alternative, that indeed only approximates TD(lambda), but requires very little computation per action and can be used with arbitrary function representation methods. The idea from which it is derived is fairly simple and not new, but probably unexplored so far. Encouraging experimental results are presented, suggesting that using lambda &gt 0 with the TTD procedure allows one to obtain a significant learning speedup at essentially the same cost as usual TD(0) learning."

There are two challenges that theory revision and other theory-guided systems face. First, a representation language appropriate for the initial theory may be inappropriate for an improved theory. While the original representation may concisely express the initial theory, a more accurate theory forced to use that same representation may be bulky, cumbersome, and difficult to reach. Second, a theory structure suitable for a coarse domain theory may be insufficient for a fine-tuned theory. Systems that produce only small, local changes to a theory have limited value for accomplishing complex structural alterations that may be required. Consequently, advanced theory-guided learning systems require flexible representation and flexible structure. An analysis of various theory revision systems and theory-guided learning systems reveals specific strengths and weaknesses in terms of these two desired properties. Designed to capture the underlying qualities of each system, a new system uses theory-guided constructive induction. Experiments in three domains show improvement over previous theory-guided systems.

We show that under some conditions, the existence of solutions can be guaranteed. We first characterize a particular subset of the variables, which we name a root set. We then introduce pivot consistency, a new local consistency which is a weak form of path consistency and can be achieved in O(n^2d^2) complexity (instead of O(n^3d^3) for path consistency), and we present associated properties; in particular, we show that any consistent instantiation of the root set can be linearly extended to a solution, which leads to the presentation of the aforementioned new method for solving by decomposing functional CSPs."

We argue, as others have done, that this foundation is inadequate because it imposes fundamentally unsatisfiable requirements. As a result, there has arisen a wide gap between theory and practice in AI, hindering progress in the field. We propose instead a property called bounded optimality. Roughly speaking, an agent is bounded-optimal if its program is a solution to the constrained optimization problem presented by its architecture and the task environment. We show how to construct agents with this property for a simple class of machine architectures in a broad class of real-time environments. We illustrate these results using a simple model of an automated mail sorting facility. We also define a weaker property, asymptotic bounded optimality (ABO), that generalizes the notion of optimality in classical complexity theory. We then construct universal ABO programs, i.e., programs that are ABO no matter what real-time constraints are applied. Universal ABO programs can be used as building blocks for more complex systems. We conclude with a discussion of the prospects for bounded optimality as a theoretical basis for AI, and relate it to similar trends in philosophy, economics, and game theory."

However, we recently found evidence that eager-commitment planners can handle a variety of planning problems more efficiently, in particular those with difficult operator choices. Resigned to the futility of trying to find a universally successful planning strategy, we devised a planner that can be used to study which domains and problems are best for which planning strategies. In this article we introduce this new planning algorithm, FLECS, which uses a FLExible Commitment Strategy with respect to plan-step orderings. It is able to use any strategy from delayed-commitment to eager-commitment. The combination of delayed and eager operator-ordering commitments allows FLECS to take advantage of the benefits of explicitly using a simulated execution state and reasoning about planning constraints. FLECS can vary its commitment strategy across different problems and domains, and also during the course of a single planning problem. FLECS represents a novel contribution to planning in that it explicitly provides the choice of which commitment strategy to use while planning.

    "abstract": "ion is one of the most promising approaches to improve the performance of problem solvers. In several domains abstraction by dropping sentences of a domain description -- as used in most hierarchical planners -- has proven useful. In this paper we present examples which illustrate significant drawbacks of abstraction by dropping sentences. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose a more general view of abstraction involving the change of representation language. We have developed a new abstraction methodology and a related sound and complete learning algorithm that allows the complete change of representation language of planning cases from concrete to abstract. However, to achieve a powerful change of the representation language, the abstract language itself as well as rules which describe admissible ways of abstracting states must be provided in the domain model. This new abstraction approach is the core of Paris (Plan Abstraction and Refinement in an Integrated System), a system in which abstract planning cases are automatically learned from given concrete cases. An empirical study in the domain of process planning in mechanical engineering shows significant advantages of the proposed reasoning from abstract cases over classical hierarchical planning."

    "abstract": "Identifying inaccurate data has long been regarded as a significant and difficult problem in AI. In this paper, we present a new method for identifying inaccurate data on the basis of qualitative correlations among related data. First, we introduce the definitions of related data and qualitative correlations among related data. Then we put forward a new concept called support coefficient function (SCF). SCF can be used to extract, represent, and calculate qualitative correlations among related data within a dataset. We propose an approach to determining dynamic shift intervals of inaccurate data, and an approach to calculating possibility of identifying inaccurate data, respectively. Both of the approaches are based on SCF. Finally we present an algorithm for identifying inaccurate data by using qualitative correlations among related data as confirmatory or disconfirmatory evidence. We have developed a practical system for interpreting infrared spectra by applying the method, and have fully tested the system against several hundred real spectra. The experimental results show that the method is significantly better than the conventional methods used in many similar systems."

Their studies within AI have been separated historically, learning being the topic of machine learning and neural networks, and reasoning falling under classical (or symbolic) AI. However, learning and reasoning are in many ways interdependent. This paper discusses the nature of some of these interdependencies and proposes a general framework called FLARE, that combines inductive learning using prior knowledge together with reasoning in a propositional setting. Several examples that test the framework are presented, including classical induction, many important reasoning protocols and two simple expert systems."

This phenomenon hurts the forward propagation of long-term context information, as well as learning a hidden state representation to represent long-term context, which depends on propagating credit information backwards in time. Using results from Markov chain theory, we show that this problem of diffusion of context and credit is reduced when the transition probabilities approach 0 or 1, i.e., the transition probability matrices are sparse and the model essentially deterministic. The results found in this paper apply to learning approaches based on continuous optimization, such as gradient descent and the Baum-Welch algorithm."

    "abstract": "Symmetric networks designed for energy minimization such as Boltzman machines and Hopfield nets are frequently investigated for use in optimization, constraint satisfaction and approximation of NP-hard problems. Nevertheless, finding a global solution (i.e., a global minimum for the energy function) is not guaranteed and even a local solution may take an exponential number of steps. We propose an improvement to the standard local activation function used for such networks. The improved algorithm guarantees that a global minimum is found in linear time for tree-like subnetworks. The algorithm, called activate, is uniform and does not assume that the network is tree-like. It can identify tree-like subnetworks even in cyclic topologies (arbitrary networks) and avoid local minima along these trees. For acyclic networks, the algorithm is guaranteed to converge to a global minimum from any initial state of the system (self-stabilization) and remains correct under various types of schedulers. On the negative side, we show that in the presence of cycles, no uniform algorithm exists that guarantees optimality even under a sequential asynchronous scheduler. An asynchronous scheduler can activate only one unit at a time while a synchronous scheduler can activate any number of units in a single time step. In addition, no uniform algorithm exists to optimize even acyclic networks when the scheduler is synchronous. Finally, we show how the algorithm can be improved using the cycle-cutset scheme. The general algorithm, called activate-with-cutset, improves over activate and has some performance guarantees that are related to the size of the network's cycle-cutset."

    "abstract": "Functionality-based recognition systems recognize objects at the category level by reasoning about how well the objects support the expected function. Such systems naturally associate a ``measure of goodness'' or ``membership value'' with a recognized object. This measure of goodness is the result of combining individual measures, or membership values, from potentially many primitive evaluations of different properties of the object's shape. A membership function is used to compute the membership value when evaluating a primitive of a particular physical property of an object. In previous versions of a recognition system known as Gruff, the membership function for each of the primitive evaluations was hand-crafted by the system designer. In this paper, we provide a learning component for the Gruff system, called Omlet, that automatically learns membership functions given a set of example objects labeled with their desired category measure. The learning algorithm is generally applicable to any problem in which low-level membership values are combined through an and-or tree structure to give a final overall membership value."

    "abstract": "This paper presents an approach to learning from situated, interactive tutorial instruction within an ongoing agent. Tutorial instruction is a flexible (and thus powerful) paradigm for teaching tasks because it allows an instructor to communicate whatever types of knowledge an agent might need in whatever situations might arise. To support this flexibility, however, the agent must be able to learn multiple kinds of knowledge from a broad range of instructional interactions. Our approach, called situated explanation, achieves such learning through a combination of analytic and inductive techniques. It combines a form of explanation-based learning that is situated for each instruction with a full suite of contextually guided responses to incomplete explanations. The approach is implemented in an agent called Instructo-Soar that learns hierarchies of new tasks and other domain knowledge from interactive natural language instructions. Instructo-Soar meets three key requirements of flexible instructability that distinguish it from previous systems: (1) it can take known or unknown commands at any instruction point; (2) it can handle instructions that apply to either its current situation or to a hypothetical situation specified in language (as in, for instance, conditional instructions); and (3) it can learn, from instructions, each class of knowledge it uses to perform tasks."

    "abstract": "In the area of inductive learning, generalization is a main operation, and the usual definition of induction is based on logical implication. Recently there has been a rising interest in clausal representation of knowledge in machine learning. Almost all inductive learning systems that perform generalization of clauses use the relation theta-subsumption instead of implication. The main reason is that there is a well-known and simple technique to compute least general generalizations under theta-subsumption, but not under implication. However generalization under theta-subsumption is inappropriate for learning recursive clauses, which is a crucial problem since recursion is the basic program structure of logic programs. We note that implication between clauses is undecidable, and we therefore introduce a stronger form of implication, called T-implication, which is decidable between clauses. We show that for every finite set of clauses there exists a least general generalization under T-implication. We describe a technique to reduce generalizations under implication of a clause to generalizations under theta-subsumption of what we call an expansion of the original clause. Moreover we show that for every non-tautological clause there exists a T-complete expansion, which means that every generalization under T-implication of the clause is reduced to a generalization under theta-subsumption of the expansion."

Interestingly, the same translation questions arise in database theory, where it has applications to the design of relational databases. This paper studies the computational complexity of these problems. Our main result is that the two translation problems are equivalent under polynomial reductions, and that they are equivalent to the corresponding decision problem. Namely, translating is equivalent to deciding whether a given set of models is the set of characteristic models for a given Horn expression. We also relate these problems to the hypergraph transversal problem, a well known problem which is related to other applications in AI and for which no polynomial time algorithm is known. It is shown that in general our translation problems are at least as hard as the hypergraph transversal problem, and in a special case they are equivalent to it."

At the core of the system are algorithms for determining whether the temporal information is consistent, and, if so, finding one or more scenarios that are consistent with the temporal information. Two important algorithms for these tasks are a path consistency algorithm and a backtracking algorithm. For the path consistency algorithm, we develop techniques that can result in up to a ten-fold speedup over an already highly optimized implementation. For the backtracking algorithm, we develop variable and value ordering heuristics that are shown empirically to dramatically improve the performance of the algorithm. As well, we show that a previously suggested reformulation of the backtracking search problem can reduce the time and space requirements of the backtracking search. Taken together, the techniques we develop allow a temporal reasoning component to solve problems that are of practical size."

In the conventional algorithm, new evidence is absorbed in O(1) time and queries are processed in time O(N), where N is the size of the network. We propose an algorithm which, after a preprocessing phase, allows us to answer queries in time O(log N) at the expense of O(log N) time per evidence absorption. The usefulness of sub-linear processing time manifests itself in applications requiring (near) real-time response over large probabilistic databases. We briefly discuss a potential application of dynamic probabilistic reasoning in computational biology."

We use these notions to develop a methodology for proving termination of general logic programs, and show how interesting problems in non-monotonic reasoning can be formalized and implemented by means of terminating general logic programs."

Clustering systems differ in the objective function used to evaluate clustering quality and the control strategy used to search the space of clusterings. Ideally, the search strategy should consistently construct clusterings of high quality, but be computationally inexpensive as well. In general, we cannot have it both ways, but we can partition the search so that a system inexpensively constructs a `tentative' clustering for initial examination, followed by iterative optimization, which continues to search in background for improved clusterings. Given this motivation, we evaluate an inexpensive strategy for creating initial clusterings, coupled with several control strategies for iterative optimization, each of which repeatedly modifies an initial clustering in search of a better one. One of these methods appears novel as an iterative optimization strategy in clustering contexts. Once a clustering has been constructed it is judged by analysts -- often according to task-specific criteria. Several authors have abstracted these criteria and posited a generic performance task akin to pattern completion, where the error rate over completed patterns is used to `externally' judge clustering utility. Given this performance task, we adapt resampling-based pruning strategies used by supervised learning systems to the task of simplifying hierarchical clusterings, thus promising to ease post-clustering analysis. Finally, we propose a number of objective functions, based on attribute-selection measures for decision-tree induction, that might perform well on the error rate and simplicity dimensions."

These planners cannot therefore construct contingency plans, i.e., plans in which different actions are performed in different circumstances. In this paper we discuss some issues that arise in the representation and construction of contingency plans and describe Cassandra, a partial-order contingency planner. Cassandra uses explicit decision-steps that enable the agent executing the plan to decide which plan branch to follow. The decision-steps in a plan result in subgoals to acquire knowledge, which are planned for in the same way as any other subgoals. Cassandra thus distinguishes the process of gathering information from the process of making decisions. The explicit representation of decisions in Cassandra allows a coherent approach to the problems of contingent planning, and provides a solid base for extensions such as the use of different decision-making procedures."

Programs incorporating imagistic reasoning have been shown to perform at an expert level in domains that defy current analytic or numerical methods. We have developed a computational paradigm, spatial aggregation, to unify the description of a class of imagistic problem solvers. A program written in this paradigm has the following properties. It takes a continuous field and optional objective functions as input, and produces high-level descriptions of structure, behavior, or control actions. It computes a multi-layer of intermediate representations, called spatial aggregates, by forming equivalence classes and adjacency relations. It employs a small set of generic operators such as aggregation, classification, and localization to perform bidirectional mapping between the information-rich field and successively more abstract spatial aggregates. It uses a data structure, the neighborhood graph, as a common interface to modularize computations. To illustrate our theory, we describe the computational structure of three implemented problem solvers -- KAM, MAPS, and HIPAIR --- in terms of the spatial aggregation generic operators by mixing and matching a library of commonly used routines."

    "title": "Accelerating Partial-Order Planners: Some Techniques for Effective Search Control and Pruning",
    "abstract": "We propose some domain-independent techniques for bringing well-founded partial-order planners closer to practicality. The first two techniques are aimed at improving search control while keeping overhead costs low. One is based on a simple adjustment to the default A* heuristic used by UCPOP to select plans for refinement. The other is based on preferring ``zero commitment'' (forced) plan refinements whenever possible, and using LIFO prioritization otherwise. A more radical technique is the use of operator parameter domains to prune search. These domains are initially computed from the definitions of the operators and the initial and goal conditions, using a polynomial-time algorithm that propagates sets of constants through the operator graph, starting in the initial conditions. During planning, parameter domains can be used to prune nonviable operator instances and to remove spurious clobbering threats. In experiments based on modifications of UCPOP, our improved plan and goal selection strategies gave speedups by factors ranging from 5 to more than 1000 for a variety of problems that are nontrivial for the unmodified version. Crucially, the hardest problems gave the greatest improvements. The pruning technique based on parameter domains often gave speedups by an order of magnitude or more for difficult problems, both with the default UCPOP search strategy and with our improved strategy. The Lisp code for our techniques and for the test problems is provided in on-line appendices."

    "title": "Cue Phrase Classification Using Machine Learning",
    "abstract": "Cue phrases may be used in a discourse sense to explicitly signal discourse structure, but also in a sentential sense to convey semantic rather than structural information. Correctly classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential is critical in natural language processing systems that exploit discourse structure, e.g., for performing tasks such as anaphora resolution and plan recognition. This paper explores the use of machine learning for classifying cue phrases as discourse or sentential. Two machine learning programs (Cgrendel and C4.5) are used to induce classification models from sets of pre-classified cue phrases and their features in text and speech. Machine learning is shown to be an effective technique for not only automating the generation of classification models, but also for improving upon previous results. When compared to manually derived classification models already in the literature, the learned models often perform with higher accuracy and contain new linguistic insights into the data. In addition, the ability to automatically construct classification models makes it easier to comparatively analyze the utility of alternative feature representations of the data. Finally, the ease of retraining makes the learning approach more scalable and flexible than manual methods."

    "abstract": "This paper lays part of the groundwork for a domain theory of negotiation, that is, a way of classifying interactions so that it is clear, given a domain, which negotiation mechanisms and strategies are appropriate. We define State Oriented Domains, a general category of interaction. Necessary and sufficient conditions for cooperation are outlined. We use the notion of worth in an altered definition of utility, thus enabling agreements in a wider class of joint-goal reachable situations. An approach is offered for conflict resolution, and it is shown that even in a conflict situation, partial cooperative steps can be taken by interacting agents (that is, agents in fundamental conflict might still agree to cooperate up to a certain point). A Unified Negotiation Protocol (UNP) is developed that can be used in all types of encounters. It is shown that in certain borderline cooperative situations, a partial cooperative agreement (i.e., one that does not achieve all agents' goals) might be preferred by all agents, even though there exists a rational agreement that would achieve all their goals. Finally, we analyze cases where agents have incomplete information on the goals and worth of other agents. First we consider the case where agents' goals are private information, and we analyze what goal declaration strategies the agents might adopt to increase their utility. Then, we consider the situation where the agents' goals (and therefore stand-alone costs) are common knowledge, but the worth they attach to their goals is private information. We introduce two mechanisms, one 'strict', the other 'tolerant', and analyze their affects on the stability and efficiency of negotiation outcomes."

    "abstract": "This paper describes an extension to the constraint satisfaction problem (CSP) called MUSE CSP (MUltiply SEgmented Constraint Satisfaction Problem). This extension is especially useful for those problems which segment into multiple sets of partially shared variables. Such problems arise naturally in signal processing applications including computer vision, speech processing, and handwriting recognition. For these applications, it is often difficult to segment the data in only one way given the low-level information utilized by the segmentation algorithms. MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent several similar instances of the constraint satisfaction problem. If multiple instances of a CSP have some common variables which have the same domains and constraints, then they can be combined into a single instance of a MUSE CSP, reducing the work required to apply the constraints. We introduce the concepts of MUSE node consistency, MUSE arc consistency, and MUSE path consistency. We then demonstrate how MUSE CSP can be used to compactly represent lexically ambiguous sentences and the multiple sentence hypotheses that are often generated by speech recognition algorithms so that grammar constraints can be used to provide parses for all syntactically correct sentences. Algorithms for MUSE arc and path consistency are provided. Finally, we discuss how to create a MUSE CSP from a set of CSPs which are labeled to indicate when the same variable is shared by more than a single CSP."

    "abstract": "A new method is proposed for exploiting causal independencies in exact Bayesian network inference. A Bayesian network can be viewed as representing a factorization of a joint probability into the multiplication of a set of conditional probabilities. We present a notion of causal independence that enables one to further factorize the conditional probabilities into a combination of even smaller factors and consequently obtain a finer-grain factorization of the joint probability. The new formulation of causal independence lets us specify the conditional probability of a variable given its parents in terms of an associative and commutative operator, such as ``or'', ``sum'' or ``max'', on the contribution of each parent. We start with a simple algorithm VE for Bayesian network inference that, given evidence and a query variable, uses the factorization to find the posterior distribution of the query. We show how this algorithm can be extended to exploit causal independence. Empirical studies, based on the CPCS networks for medical diagnosis, show that this method is more efficient than previous methods and allows for inference in larger networks than previous algorithms."

    "abstract": "Previous approaches of analyzing spontaneously spoken language often have been based on encoding syntactic and semantic knowledge manually and symbolically. While there has been some progress using statistical or connectionist language models, many current spoken- language systems still use a relatively brittle, hand-coded symbolic grammar or symbolic semantic component. In contrast, we describe a so-called screening approach for learning robust processing of spontaneously spoken language. A screening approach is a flat analysis which uses shallow sequences of category representations for analyzing an utterance at various syntactic, semantic and dialog levels. Rather than using a deeply structured symbolic analysis, we use a flat connectionist analysis. This screening approach aims at supporting speech and language processing by using (1) data-driven learning and (2) robustness of connectionist networks. In order to test this approach, we have developed the SCREEN system which is based on this new robust, learned and flat analysis. In this paper, we focus on a detailed description of SCREEN's architecture, the flat syntactic and semantic analysis, the interaction with a speech recognizer, and a detailed evaluation analysis of the robustness under the influence of noisy or incomplete input. The main result of this paper is that flat representations allow more robust processing of spontaneous spoken language than deeply structured representations. In particular, we show how the fault-tolerance and learning capability of connectionist networks can support a flat analysis for providing more robust spoken-language processing within an overall hybrid symbolic/connectionist framework."

One interesting feature of such formalisms is the possibility of defining a class, i.e., providing a set of properties that precisely characterize the instances of the class. Many recent articles point out that there are several ways of assigning a meaning to a class definition containing some sort of recursion. In this paper, we argue that, instead of choosing a single style of semantics, we achieve better results by adopting a formalism that allows for different semantics to coexist. We demonstrate the feasibility of our argument, by presenting a knowledge representation formalism, the description logic muALCQ, with the above characteristics. In addition to the constructs for conjunction, disjunction, negation, quantifiers, and qualified number restrictions, muALCQ includes special fixpoint constructs to express (suitably interpreted) recursive definitions. These constructs enable the usual frame-based descriptions to be combined with definitions of recursive data structures such as directed acyclic graphs, lists, streams, etc. We establish several properties of muALCQ, including the decidability and the computational complexity of reasoning, by formulating a correspondence with a particular modal logic of programs called the modal mu-calculus."

    "abstract": "We describe a new paradigm for implementing inference in belief networks, which consists of two steps: (1) compiling a belief network into an arithmetic expression called a Query DAG (Q-DAG); and (2) answering queries using a simple evaluation algorithm. Each node of a Q-DAG represents a numeric operation, a number, or a symbol for evidence. Each leaf node of a Q-DAG represents the answer to a network query, that is, the probability of some event of interest. It appears that Q-DAGs can be generated using any of the standard algorithms for exact inference in belief networks (we show how they can be generated using clustering and conditioning algorithms). The time and space complexity of a Q-DAG generation algorithm is no worse than the time complexity of the inference algorithm on which it is based. The complexity of a Q-DAG evaluation algorithm is linear in the size of the Q-DAG, and such inference amounts to a standard evaluation of the arithmetic expression it represents. The intended value of Q-DAGs is in reducing the software and hardware resources required to utilize belief networks in on-line, real-world applications. The proposed framework also facilitates the development of on-line inference on different software and hardware platforms due to the simplicity of the Q-DAG evaluation algorithm. Interestingly enough, Q-DAGs were found to serve other purposes: simple techniques for reducing Q-DAGs tend to subsume relatively complex optimization techniques for belief-network inference, such as network-pruning and computation-caching."

Connectionist theory-refinement systems, which use background knowledge to select a neural network's topology and initial weights, have proven to be effective at exploiting domain-specific knowledge; however, most do not exploit available computing power. This weakness occurs because they lack the ability to refine the topology of the neural networks they produce, thereby limiting generalization, especially when given impoverished domain theories. We present the REGENT algorithm which uses (a) domain-specific knowledge to help create an initial population of knowledge-based neural networks and (b) genetic operators of crossover and mutation (specifically designed for knowledge-based networks) to continually search for better network topologies. Experiments on three real-world domains indicate that our new algorithm is able to significantly increase generalization compared to a standard connectionist theory-refinement system, as well as our previous algorithm for growing knowledge-based networks."

In particular, we describe the Least-Cost Flaw Repair (LCFR) strategy developed and analyzed by Joslin and Pollack (1994), and compare it with other strategies, including Gerevini and Schubert's (1996) ZLIFO strategy. LCFR and ZLIFO make very different, and apparently conflicting claims about the most effective way to reduce search-space size in POCL planning. We resolve this conflict, arguing that much of the benefit that Gerevini and Schubert ascribe to the LIFO component of their ZLIFO strategy is better attributed to other causes. We show that for many problems, a strategy that combines least-cost flaw selection with the delay of separable threats will be effective in reducing search-space size, and will do so without excessive computational overhead. Although such a strategy thus provides a good default, we also show that certain domain characteristics may reduce its effectiveness."

We test the generality of this explanation by examining one of its predictions: if the number of solutions is held fixed by the choice of problems, then increased pruning should lead to a monotonic decrease in search cost. Instead, we find the easy-hard-easy pattern in median search cost even when the number of solutions is held constant, for some search methods. This generalizes previous observations of this pattern and shows that the existing theory does not explain the full range of the peak in search cost. In these cases the pattern appears to be due to changes in the size of the minimal unsolvable subproblems, rather than changing numbers of solutions."

    "abstract": "Many AI researchers are today striving to build agent teams for complex, dynamic multi-agent domains, with intended applications in arenas such as education, training, entertainment, information integration, and collective robotics. Unfortunately, uncertainties in these complex, dynamic domains obstruct coherent teamwork. In particular, team members often encounter differing, incomplete, and possibly inconsistent views of their environment. Furthermore, team members can unexpectedly fail in fulfilling responsibilities or discover unexpected opportunities. Highly flexible coordination and communication is key in addressing such uncertainties. Simply fitting individual agents with precomputed coordination plans will not do, for their inflexibility can cause severe failures in teamwork, and their domain-specificity hinders reusability. Our central hypothesis is that the key to such flexibility and reusability is providing agents with general models of teamwork. Agents exploit such models to autonomously reason about coordination and communication, providing requisite flexibility. Furthermore, the models enable reuse across domains, both saving implementation effort and enforcing consistency. This article presents one general, implemented model of teamwork, called STEAM. The basic building block of teamwork in STEAM is joint intentions (Cohen & Levesque, 1991b); teamwork in STEAM is based on agents' building up a (partial) hierarchy of joint intentions (this hierarchy is seen to parallel Grosz & Kraus's partial SharedPlans, 1996). Furthermore, in STEAM, team members monitor the team's and individual members' performance, reorganizing the team as necessary. Finally, decision-theoretic communication selectivity in STEAM ensures reduction in communication overheads of teamwork, with appropriate sensitivity to the environmental conditions. This article describes STEAM's application in three different complex domains, and presents detailed empirical results."

    "abstract": "Case-Based Planning (CBP) provides a way of scaling up domain-independent planning to solve large problems in complex domains. It replaces the detailed and lengthy search for a solution with the retrieval and adaptation of previous planning experiences. In general, CBP has been demonstrated to improve performance over generative (from-scratch) planning. However, the performance improvements it provides are dependent on adequate judgements as to problem similarity. In particular, although CBP may substantially reduce planning effort overall, it is subject to a mis-retrieval problem. The success of CBP depends on these retrieval errors being relatively rare. This paper describes the design and implementation of a replay framework for the case-based planner DERSNLP+EBL. DERSNLP+EBL extends current CBP methodology by incorporating explanation-based learning techniques that allow it to explain and learn from the retrieval failures it encounters. These techniques are used to refine judgements about case similarity in response to feedback when a wrong decision has been made. The same failure analysis is used in building the case library, through the addition of repairing cases. Large problems are split and stored as single goal subproblems. Multi-goal problems are stored only when these smaller cases fail to be merged into a full solution. An empirical evaluation of this approach demonstrates the advantage of learning from experienced retrieval failure."

It is difficult to solve POMDPs exactly. This paper proposes a new approximation scheme. The basic idea is to transform a POMDP into another one where additional information is provided by an oracle. The oracle informs the planning agent that the current state of the world is in a certain region. The transformed POMDP is consequently said to be region observable. It is easier to solve than the original POMDP. We propose to solve the transformed POMDP and use its optimal policy to construct an approximate policy for the original POMDP. By controlling the amount of additional information that the oracle provides, it is possible to find a proper tradeoff between computational time and approximation quality. In terms of algorithmic contributions, we study in details how to exploit region observability in solving the transformed POMDP. To facilitate the study, we also propose a new exact algorithm for general POMDPs. The algorithm is conceptually simple and yet is significantly more efficient than all previous exact algorithms."

In such a model the environment state (controlled by Nature) may change arbitrarily, and the feedback/reward function is initially unknown. The agent is not Bayesian, that is he does not form a prior probability neither on the state selection strategy of Nature, nor on his reward function. A policy for the agent is a function which assigns an action to every history of observations and actions. Two basic feedback structures are considered. In one of them -- the perfect monitoring case -- the agent is able to observe the previous environment state as part of his feedback, while in the other -- the imperfect monitoring case -- all that is available to the agent is the reward obtained. Both of these settings refer to partially observable processes, where the current environment state is unknown. Our main result refers to the competitive ratio criterion in the perfect monitoring case. We prove the existence of an efficient stochastic policy that ensures that the competitive ratio is obtained at almost all stages with an arbitrarily high probability, where efficiency is measured in terms of rate of convergence. It is further shown that such an optimal policy does not exist in the imperfect monitoring case. Moreover, it is proved that in the perfect monitoring case there does not exist a deterministic policy that satisfies our long run optimality criterion. In addition, we discuss the maxmin criterion and prove that a deterministic efficient optimal strategy does exist in the imperfect monitoring case under this criterion. Finally we show that our approach to long-run optimality can be viewed as qualitative, which distinguishes it from previous work in this area."

We identify several interesting features of plateaus that impact the performance of local search algorithms. We show that local minima tend to be small but occasionally may be very large. We also show that local minima can be escaped without unsatisfying a large number of clauses, but that systematically searching for an escape route may be computationally expensive if the local minimum is large. We show that plateaus with exits, called benches, tend to be much larger than minima, and that some benches have very few exit states which local search can use to escape. We show that the solutions (i.e., global minima) of randomly generated problem instances form clusters, which behave similarly to local minima.

Although there is still wide-spread belief that bidirectional heuristic search is afflicted by the problem of search frontiers passing each other, we demonstrate that this conjecture is wrong. Based on this finding, we present both a new generic approach to bidirectional heuristic search and a new approach to dynamically improving heuristic values that is feasible in bidirectional search only. These approaches are put into perspective with both the traditional and more recently proposed approaches in order to facilitate a better overall understanding. Empirical results of experiments with our new approaches show that bidirectional heuristic search can be performed very efficiently and also with limited memory. These results suggest that bidirectional heuristic search appears to be better for solving certain difficult problems than corresponding unidirectional search. This provides some evidence for the usefulness of a search strategy that was long neglected. In summary, we show that bidirectional heuristic search is viable and consequently propose that it be reconsidered."

On the other hand, the many frameworks and schemes proposed in the literature for theory update and revision are plagued by serious complexity-theoretic impediments, even in the Horn case, as was pointed out by Eiter and Gottlob (1992), and is further demonstrated in the present paper. More fundamentally, these schemes are not inductive, in that they may lose in a single update any positive properties of the represented sets of formulas (small size, Horn structure, etc.). In this paper we propose a new scheme, incremental recompilation, which combines Horn approximation and model-based updates; this scheme is inductive and very efficient, free of the problems facing its constituents. A set of formulas is represented by an upper and lower Horn approximation. To update, we replace the upper Horn formula by the Horn envelope of its minimum-change update, and similarly the lower one by the Horn core of its update; the key fact which enables this scheme is that Horn envelopes and cores are easy to compute when the underlying formula is the result of a minimum-change update of a Horn formula by a clause. We conjecture that efficient algorithms are possible for more complex updates."

The domain independent approaches are applicable across a variety of domains, but may not be very efficient in any one given domain. The domain dependent approaches need to be (re)designed for each domain separately, but can be very efficient in the domain for which they are designed. One enticing alternative to these approaches is to automatically synthesize domain independent planners given the knowledge about the domain and the theory of planning. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of using existing automated software synthesis tools to support such synthesis. Specifically, we describe an architecture called CLAY in which the Kestrel Interactive Development System (KIDS) is used to derive a domain-customized planner through a semi-automatic combination of a declarative theory of planning, and the declarative control knowledge specific to a given domain, to semi-automatically combine them to derive domain-customized planners. We discuss what it means to write a declarative theory of planning and control knowledge for KIDS, and illustrate our approach by generating a class of domain-specific planners using state space refinements. Our experiments show that the synthesized planners can outperform classical refinement planners (implemented as instantiations of UCP, Kambhampati & Srivastava, 1995), using the same control knowledge. We will contrast the costs and benefits of the synthesis approach with conventional methods for customizing domain independent planners."

    "abstract": "This paper introduces new algorithms and data structures for quick counting for machine learning datasets. We focus on the counting task of constructing contingency tables, but our approach is also applicable to counting the number of records in a dataset that match conjunctive queries. Subject to certain assumptions, the costs of these operations can be shown to be independent of the number of records in the dataset and loglinear in the number of non-zero entries in the contingency table. We provide a very sparse data structure, the ADtree, to minimize memory use. We provide analytical worst-case bounds for this structure for several models of data distribution. We empirically demonstrate that tractably-sized data structures can be produced for large real-world datasets by (a) using a sparse tree structure that never allocates memory for counts of zero, (b) never allocating memory for counts that can be deduced from other counts, and (c) not bothering to expand the tree fully near its leaves. We show how the ADtree can be used to accelerate Bayes net structure finding algorithms, rule learning algorithms, and feature selection algorithms, and we provide a number of empirical results comparing ADtree methods against traditional direct counting approaches. We also discuss the possible uses of ADtrees in other machine learning methods, and discuss the merits of ADtrees in comparison with alternative representations such as kd-trees, R-trees and Frequent Sets."

    "abstract": "In this paper we consider the problem of `theory patching', in which we are given a domain theory, some of whose components are indicated to be possibly flawed, and a set of labeled training examples for the domain concept. The theory patching problem is to revise only the indicated components of the theory, such that the resulting theory correctly classifies all the training examples. Theory patching is thus a type of theory revision in which revisions are made to individual components of the theory. Our concern in this paper is to determine for which classes of logical domain theories the theory patching problem is tractable. We consider both propositional and first-order domain theories, and show that the theory patching problem is equivalent to that of determining what information contained in a theory is `stable' regardless of what revisions might be performed to the theory. We show that determining stability is tractable if the input theory satisfies two conditions: that revisions to each theory component have monotonic effects on the classification of examples, and that theory components act independently in the classification of examples in the theory. We also show how the concepts introduced can be used to determine the soundness and completeness of particular theory patching algorithms."

We show that, contrary to previous results for decision tree learning, windowing can in fact achieve significant run-time gains in noise-free domains and explain the different behavior of rule learning algorithms by the fact that they learn each rule independently. The main contribution of this paper is integrative windowing, a new type of algorithm that further exploits this property by integrating good rules into the final theory right after they have been discovered. Thus it avoids re-learning these rules in subsequent iterations of the windowing process. Experimental evidence in a variety of noise-free domains shows that integrative windowing can in fact achieve substantial run-time gains. Furthermore, we discuss the problem of noise in windowing and present an algorithm that is able to achieve run-time gains in a set of experiments in a simple domain with artificial noise."

Specifically, we first introduce the notion of a consequence, which is a syntactically unconstrained propositional sentence that characterizes all consistency-based diagnoses and show that standard characterizations of diagnoses, such as minimal conflicts, correspond to syntactic variations on a consequence. Second, we propose a new syntactic variation on the consequence known as negation normal form (NNF) and discuss its merits compared to standard variations. Third, we introduce a basic algorithm for computing consequences in NNF given a structured system description. We show that if the system structure does not contain cycles, then there is always a linear-size consequence in NNF which can be computed in linear time. For arbitrary system structures, we show a precise connection between the complexity of computing consequences and the topology of the underlying system structure. Finally, we present an algorithm that enumerates the preferred diagnoses characterized by a consequence. The algorithm is shown to take linear time in the size of the consequence if the preference criterion satisfies some general conditions."

Macros are used by the problem solver as if they were basic operators. The major problem that macro-learning presents is the vast number of macros that are available for acquisition. Macros increase the branching factor of the search space and can severely degrade problem-solving efficiency. To make macro learning useful, a program must be selective in acquiring and utilizing macros. This paper describes a general method for selective acquisition of macros. Solvable training problems are generated in increasing order of difficulty. The only macros acquired are those that take the problem solver out of a local minimum to a better state. The utility of the method is demonstrated in several domains, including the domain of NxN sliding-tile puzzles. After learning on small puzzles, the system is able to efficiently solve puzzles of any size."

In the process of proving that certain planning problems are complete for NP^PP, we introduce a new basic NP^PP-complete problem, E-MAJSAT, which generalizes the standard Boolean satisfiability problem to computations involving probabilistic quantities; our results suggest that the development of good heuristics for E-MAJSAT could be important for the creation of efficient algorithms for a wide variety of problems."

A computational theory of daydreaming and its implementation as the program DAYDREAMER are presented. DAYDREAMER consists of 1) a scenario generator based on relaxed planning, 2) a dynamic episodic memory of experiences used by the scenario generator, 3) a collection of personal goals and control goals which guide the scenario generator, 4) an emotion component in which daydreams initiate, and are initiated by, emotional states arising from goal outcomes, and 5) domain knowledge of interpersonal relations and common everyday occurrences.   The role of emotions and control goals in daydreaming is discussed. Four control goals commonly used in guiding daydreaming are presented: rationalization, failure/success reversal, revenge, and preparation. The role of episodic memory in daydreaming is considered, including how daydreamed information is incorporated into memory and later used. An initial version of DAYDREAMER which produces several daydreams (in English) is currently running."

In recent years two special cases of belief change, belief revision and belief update, have been studied in detail. In a companion paper (Friedman & Halpern, 1997), we introduce a new framework to model belief change. This framework combines temporal and epistemic modalities with a notion of plausibility, allowing us to examine the change of beliefs over time. In this paper, we show how belief revision and belief update can be captured in our framework. This allows us to compare the assumptions made by each method, and to better understand the principles underlying them. In particular, it shows that Katsuno and Mendelzon's notion of belief update (Katsuno & Mendelzon, 1991a) depends on several strong assumptions that may limit its applicability in artificial intelligence. Finally, our analysis allow us to identify a notion of minimal change that underlies a broad range of belief change operations including revision and update."

A candidate solution is sketched: Symbolic representations must be grounded bottom-up in nonsymbolic representations of two kinds: (1) \"iconic representations,\" which are analogs of the proximal sensory projections of distal objects and events, and (2) \"categorical representations,\" which are learned and innate feature-detectors that pick out the invariant features of object and event categories from their sensory projections. Elementary symbols are the names of these object and event categories, assigned on the basis of their (nonsymbolic) categorical representations.

    "abstract": "Agents are small programs that autonomously take actions based on changes in their environment or ``state.'' Over the last few years, there have been an increasing number of efforts to build agents that can interact and/or collaborate with other agents. In one of these efforts, Eiter, Subrahmanian amd Pick (AIJ, 108(1-2), pages 179-255) have shown how agents may be built on top of legacy code. However, their framework assumes that agent states are completely determined, and there is no uncertainty in an agent's state. Thus, their framework allows an agent developer to specify how his agents will react when the agent is 100% sure about what is true/false in the world state. In this paper, we propose the concept of a \\emph{probabilistic agent program} and show how, given an arbitrary program written in any imperative language, we may build a declarative ``probabilistic'' agent program on top of it which supports decision making in the presence of uncertainty. We provide two alternative semantics for probabilistic agent programs. We show that the second semantics, though more epistemically appealing, is more complex to compute. We provide sound and complete algorithms to compute the semantics of \\emph{positive} agent programs."

For each logic we develop a comprehensive semantic framework based on the notion of a belief pair. The set of all belief pairs together with the so called knowledge ordering forms a complete lattice. For each logic, we introduce several semantics by means of fixpoints of operators on the lattice of belief pairs. Our results elucidate an underlying isomorphism of the respective semantic constructions. In particular, we show that the interpretation of defaults as modal formulas proposed by Konolige allows us to represent all semantics for default logic in terms of the corresponding semantics for autoepistemic logic. Thus, our results conclusively establish that default logic can indeed be viewed as a fragment of autoepistemic logic. However, as we also demonstrate, the semantics of Moore and Reiter are given by different operators and occupy different locations in their corresponding families of semantics. This result explains the source of the longstanding difficulty to formally relate these two semantics. In the paper, we also discuss approximating skeptical reasoning with autoepistemic and default logics and establish constructive principles behind such approximations."

Thus, when studying randomized algorithms, there are two important characteristics that need to be considered: the running time and, even more importantly, the accuracy --- a measure of likelihood that a satisfying assignment will be found, provided one exists. In fact, we argue that without a reference to the accuracy, the notion of the running time for randomized algorithms is not well-defined. In this paper, we introduce a formal notion of accuracy. We use it to define a concept of the running time. We use both notions to study the random walk strategy GSAT algorithm. We investigate the dependence of accuracy on properties of input formulas such as clause-to-variable ratio and the number of satisfying assignments. We demonstrate that the running time of GSAT grows exponentially in the number of variables of the input formula for randomly generated 3-CNF formulas and for the formulas encoding 3- and 4-colorability of graphs."

I propose that until a private syntax (syntactic autonomy) is discovered by dynamically coherent agents, there are no significant or interesting types of closure or autonomy. When syntactic autonomy is established, then, because of a process of description-based selected self-organization, open-ended evolution is enabled. At this stage, agents depend, in addition to dynamics, on localized, symbolic memory, thus adding a level of dynamical incoherence to their interaction with the environment. Furthermore, it is the appearance of syntactic autonomy which enables much more interesting types of closures amongst agents which share the same syntax. To investigate how we can study the emergence of syntax from dynamical systems, experiments with cellular automata leading to emergent computation to solve non-trivial tasks are discussed. RNA editing is also mentioned as a process that may have been used to obtain a primordial biological code necessary open-ended evolution."

To compute such deletion and addition, we propose an adaptation of our top-down abductive proof procedure to compute a relevant abducibles to an added rule. We compute a minimally revised program, by choosing a minimal set of abducibles among all the sets of abducibles computed by a top-down proof procedure."

The relevance relations are ternary (using context as a parameter) as opposed to standard binary axiomatizations. The inference operation thus defined easily handles iterated revision by maintaining a revision history, blocks the derivation of inconsistent answers from a possibly inconsistent sequence and maintains the distinction between explicit and implicit beliefs.

Next, we introduce an accessibility ordering for belief sets, which we then use for selecting the best (optimal) contexts with respect to the processing effort involved in the revision. Then, for finitely axiomatizable knowledge bases, we characterize a finite accessibility ranking from which the accessibility ordering for the entire base is generated and show how to determine the ranking of an arbitrary sentence in the language.

On the other hand, a logic-based control language like \\congolog, based on the situation calculus, is well-suited for the latter. However, it has problems expressing event-driven behavior. In this paper, we show how these problems can be overcome by first extending the situation calculus to support continuous change and event-driven behavior and then presenting \\ccgolog, a variant of \\congolog which is based on the extended situation calculus. One benefit of \\ccgolog is that it narrows the gap in expressiveness compared to non-logic-based control languages while preserving a semantically well-founded projection mechanism."

    "abstract": "Over the past decade a considerable amount of research has been done to expand logic programming languages to handle incomplete information. One such language is the language of epistemic specifications. As is usual with logic programming languages, the problem of answering queries is intractable in the general case. For extended disjunctive logic programs, an idea that has proven useful in simplifying the investigation of answer sets is the use of splitting sets. In this paper we will present an extended definition of splitting sets that will be applicable to epistemic specifications. Furthermore, an extension of the splitting set theorem will be presented. Also, a characterization of stratified epistemic specifications will be given in terms of splitting sets. This characterization leads us to an algorithmic method of computing world views of a subclass of epistemic logic programs."

In this paper we present two encodings of DES as logic programs: a direct one out of the standard specifications and an optimized one extending the work of Massacci and Marraro. The computational properties of the encodings are studied by using them for DES key search with the Smodels system as the implementation of the stable model semantics. Results indicate that the encodings and Smodels are quite competitive: they outperform state-of-the-art SAT-checkers working with an optimized encoding of DES into SAT and are comparable with a SAT-checker that is customized and tuned for the optimized SAT encoding."

We also presented an algorithm for compiling any conjunctive normal form (CNF) into DNNF and provided a structure-based guarantee on its space and time complexity. We present in this paper a linear-time algorithm for converting an ordered binary decision diagram (OBDD) representation of a propositional theory into an equivalent DNNF, showing that DNNFs scale as well as OBDDs. We also identify a subclass of DNNF which we call deterministic DNNF, d-DNNF, and show that the previous complexity guarantees on compiling DNNF continue to hold for this stricter subclass, which has stronger properties. In particular, we present a new operation on d-DNNF which allows us to count its models under the assertion, retraction and flipping of every literal by traversing the d-DNNF twice. That is, after such traversal, we can test in constant-time: the entailment of any literal by the d-DNNF, and the consistency of the d-DNNF under the retraction or flipping of any literal. We demonstrate the significance of these new operations by showing how they allow us to implement linear-time, complete truth maintenance systems and linear-time, complete belief revision systems for two important classes of propositional theories."

In this paper we study how one such framework, the Language E, can form the basis for planning under (possibly) incomplete information. We define two types of plans: weak and safe plans, and propose a planner, called the E-Planner, which is often able to extend an initial weak plan into a safe plan even though the (explicit) information available is incomplete, e.g. for cases where the initial state is not completely known. The E-Planner is based upon a reformulation of the Language E in argumentation terms and a natural proof theory resulting from the reformulation. It uses an extension of this proof theory by means of abduction for the generation of plans and adopts argumentation-based techniques for extending weak plans into safe plans. We provide representative examples illustrating the behaviour of the E-Planner, in particular for cases where the status of fluents is incompletely known."

Formally, a knowledge base K and sentence A are expressed, via renaming propositions in K, in separate languages. Using a maximization process, we assume the languages are the same insofar as consistently possible. Lastly, we express the resultant knowledge base in a single language. There may be more than one way in which A can be so extended by K: in choice revision, one such ``extension'' represents the revised state; alternately revision consists of the intersection of all such extensions.   The most general formulation of our approach is flexible enough to express other approaches to revision and update, the merging of knowledge bases, and the incorporation of static and dynamic integrity constraints. Our framework differs from work based on ordinal conditional functions, notably with respect to iterated revision. We argue that the approach is well-suited for implementation: the choice revision operator gives better complexity results than general revision; the approach can be expressed in terms of a finite knowledge base; and the scope of a revision can be restricted to just those propositions mentioned in the sentence for revision A."

Propositional logic is, arguably, the simplest ASP system with an intuitive semantics supporting direct modeling of problem constraints. However, for some applications, especially those requiring that transitive closure be computed, it requires additional variables and results in large theories. Consequently, it may not be a practical computational tool for such problems. On the other hand, ASP systems based on nonmonotonic logics, such as stable logic programming, can handle transitive closure computation efficiently and, in general, yield very concise theories as problem representations. Their semantics is, however, more complex. Searching for the middle ground, in this paper we introduce a new nonmonotonic logic, DATALOG with constraints or DC. Informally, DC theories consist of propositional clauses (constraints) and of Horn rules. The semantics is a simple and natural extension of the semantics of the propositional logic. However, thanks to the presence of Horn rules in the system, modeling of transitive closure becomes straightforward. We describe the syntax and semantics of DC, and study its properties. We discuss an implementation of DC and present results of experimental study of the effectiveness of DC, comparing it with CSAT, a satisfiability checker and SMODELS implementation of stable logic programming.

This theory is distinguished from the familiar parallel-distributed adaptation theory of neural networks in terms of channel-based convergence to the target rules. We show how to realize this theory in a learning system named CFRule. CFRule is a parallel weight-based model, but it departs from traditional neural computing in that its internal knowledge is comprehensible. Furthermore, when the model converges upon training, each channel converges to a target rule. The model adaptation rule is derived by multi-level parallel weight optimization based on gradient descent. Since, however, gradient descent only guarantees local optimization, a multi-channel regression-based optimization strategy is developed to effectively deal with this problem. Formally, we prove that the CFRule model can explicitly and precisely encode any given rule set. Also, we prove a property related to asynchronous parallel convergence, which is a critical element of the multi-channel parallel adaptation theory for rule learning. Thanks to the quantizability nature of the CFRule model, rules can be extracted completely and soundly via a threshold-based mechanism. Finally, the practical application of the theory is demonstrated in DNA promoter recognition and hepatitis prognosis prediction."

This can be compared with Rhetorical Structure Theory (RST) (Mann & Thompson 1988), an approach that originates in discourse analysis. In p-d terms an argument is good if it avoids committing a fallacy, whereas in RST terms an argument is good if it is coherent. RST has been criticised (Snoeck Henkemans 1997) for providing only a partially functional account of argument, and similar criticisms have been raised in the Natural Language Generation (NLG) community-particularly by Moore & Pollack (1992)- with regards to its account of intentionality in text in general. Mann and Thompson themselves note that although RST can be successfully applied to a wide range of texts from diverse domains, it fails to characterise some types of text, most notably legal contracts. There is ongoing research in the Artificial Intelligence and Law community exploring the potential for providing electronic support to contract negotiators, focusing on long-term, complex engineering agreements (see for example Daskalopulu & Sergot 1997). This paper provides a brief introduction to RST and illustrates its shortcomings with respect to contractual text. An alternative approach for modelling argument structure is presented which not only caters for contractual text, but also overcomes the aforementioned limitations of RST."

We give a thorough analysis of properties of our approach, to get a better understanding of the causal rejection principle. We review postulates for update and revision operators from the area of theory change and nonmonotonic reasoning, and some new properties are considered as well. We then consider refinements of our semantics which incorporate a notion of minimality of change. As well, we investigate the relationship to other approaches, showing that our approach is semantically equivalent to inheritance programs by Buccafurri et al. and that it coincides with certain classes of dynamic logic programs, for which we provide characterizations in terms of graph conditions. Therefore, most of our results about properties of causal rejection principle apply to these approaches as well.

We concentrate on a number of families of nonmonotonic consequence relations, defined in the style of Gentzen. Both proof-theoretic and semantic points of view are developed in parallel. The former point of view was pioneered by D. Gabbay, while the latter has been advocated by Y. Shoham in. Five such families are defined and characterized by representation theorems, relating the two points of view. One of the families of interest, that of preferential relations, turns out to have been studied by E. Adams. The \"preferential\" models proposed here are a much stronger tool than Adams' probabilistic semantics. The basic language used in this paper is that of propositional logic.

We look for a plausible definition of the set of all conditional assertions entailed by a conditional knowledge base. In a previous paper, S. Kraus and the authors defined and studied \"preferential\" consequence relations. They noticed that not all preferential relations could be considered as reasonable inference procedures. This paper studies a more restricted class of consequence relations, \"rational\" relations. It is argued that any reasonable nonmonotonic inference procedure should define a rational relation. It is shown that the rational relations are exactly those that may be represented by a \"ranked\" preferential model, or by a (non-standard) probabilistic model. The rational closure of a conditional knowledge base is defined and shown to provide an attractive answer to the question of the title.

An ordered logic program is an extended logic program in which rules are named by unique terms, and in which preferences among rules are given by a set of atoms of form s < t where s and t are names. An ordered logic program is transformed into a second, regular, extended logic program wherein the preferences are respected, in that the answer sets obtained in the transformed program correspond with the preferred answer sets of the original program. Our approach allows the specification of dynamic orderings, in which preferences can appear arbitrarily within a program. Static orderings (in which preferences are external to a logic program) are a trivial restriction of the general dynamic case. First, we develop a specific approach to reasoning with preferences, wherein the preference ordering specifies the order in which rules are to be applied. We then demonstrate the wide range of applicability of our framework by showing how other approaches, among them that of Brewka and Eiter, can be captured within our framework. Since the result of each of these transformations is an extended logic program, we can make use of existing implementations, such as dlv and smodels. To this end, we have developed a publicly available compiler as a front-end for these programming systems."

However, many important aspects of prioritized default reasoning have yet to be thoroughly explored. In this paper, we investigate two properties of prioritized logic programs in the context of answer set semantics. Specifically, we reveal a close relationship between mutual defeasibility and uniqueness of the answer set for a prioritized logic program. We then explore how the splitting technique for extended logic programs can be extended to prioritized logic programs. We prove splitting theorems that can be used to simplify the evaluation of a prioritized logic program under certain conditions."

    "abstract": "Representing defeasibility is an important issue in common sense reasoning. In reasoning about action and change, this issue becomes more difficult because domain and action related defeasible information may conflict with general inertia rules. Furthermore, different types of defeasible information may also interfere with each other during the reasoning. In this paper, we develop a prioritized logic programming approach to handle defeasibilities in reasoning about action. In particular, we propose three action languages {\\cal AT}^{0}, {\\cal AT}^{1} and {\\cal AT}^{2} which handle three types of defeasibilities in action domains named defeasible constraints, defeasible observations and actions with defeasible and abnormal effects respectively. Each language with a higher superscript can be viewed as an extension of the language with a lower superscript. These action languages inherit the simple syntax of {\\cal A} language but their semantics is developed in terms of transition systems where transition functions are defined based on prioritized logic programs. By illustrating various examples, we show that our approach eventually provides a powerful mechanism to handle various defeasibilities in temporal prediction and postdiction. We also investigate semantic properties of these three action languages and characterize classes of action domains that present more desirable solutions in reasoning about action within the underlying action languages."

However, despite superficial similarities, there are features of open programs that have no immediate counterpart in the framework of abduction and viceversa. Similarly, open programs cannot be immediately simulated with answer set programming (ASP). In this paper we start a thorough investigation of the relationships between open inference, abduction and ASP. We shall prove that open programs generalize the other two frameworks. The generalized framework suggests interesting extensions of abduction under the generalized stable model semantics. In some cases, we will be able to reduce open inference to abduction and ASP, thereby estimating its computational complexity. At the same time, the aforementioned reduction opens the way to new applications of abduction and ASP."

Various ways to solve conflicts between contradictory pieces of information have been proposed in the context of argumentation, nonmonotonic reasoning or logic programming, and can be captured by appropriate semantics within Dung's framework. A common feature of these semantics is that one can always maximize in some sense the set of acceptable arguments. We propose in this paper to extend Dung's framework in order to allow for the representation of what we call ``restricted'' arguments: these arguments should only be used if absolutely necessary, that is, in order to support other arguments that would otherwise be defeated. We modify Dung's preferred semantics accordingly: a set of arguments becomes acceptable only if it contains a minimum of restricted arguments, for a maximum of unrestricted arguments."

On the one hand, complexity results are identified, showing that the inference problem from a compiled weighted base is as difficult as in the general case, when the prime implicates, Horn cover or renamable Horn cover classes are targeted. On the other hand, we show that the inference problem becomes tractable whenever DNNF-compilations are used and clausal queries are considered. Moreover, we show that the set of all preferred models of a DNNF-compilation of a weighted base can be computed in time polynomial in the output size.

The paper describes the main problems faced in this representation task and presents the results of an empirical study, carried out through a series of controlled experiments, to analyze the computational performance of reasoning in these representations. The experiments compare different representations obtained, for example, by changing the basic ontology of the domain or by varying the degree of use of indirect effect laws through domain constraints. This study has helped to expose the main sources of computational difficulty in the reasoning and suggest some methodological guidelines for representing complex domains.

The suitability of the new approach is convinced by the fact that many attractive properties are satisfied by our semantics. In particular, our semantics is still correct with respect to various existing answer sets semantics while it successfully overcomes the weakness of their generalization to well-founded semantics.

That is, the new formalisms properly generalize their counterparts in classical default reasoning, they are weaker than model-theoretic probabilistic entailment, and they are stronger than probabilistic entailment under coherence. The new formalisms are useful especially for handling probabilistic inconsistencies related to conditioning on zero events. They can also be applied for probabilistic belief revision. More generally, in the same spirit as a similar previous paper, this paper sheds light on exciting new formalisms for probabilistic reasoning beyond the well-known standard ones."

This ``certain sort'' specification picks out the models that are relevant to the inference, taking into account factors such as specificity and vagueness, and previous inferences. The frequencies characterizing the relevant models reflect known frequencies in our actual world. The criteria of adequacy for a default inference can be extended by thresholding to criteria of adequacy for an extension. We show that this avoids the implausibilities that might otherwise result from the chaining of default inferences. The model proportions, when construed in terms of frequencies, provide a verifiable grounding of default rules, and can become the basis for generating default rules from statistics."

We first describe a formal model which captures various update approaches, and we define a logical language for expressing properties of evolving knowledge bases. We then investigate semantical and computational properties of our framework, where we focus on properties of knowledge states with respect to the canonical reasoning task of whether a given formula holds on a given evolving knowledge base. In particular, we present finitary characterizations of the evolution for certain classes of framework instances, which can be exploited for obtaining decidability results. In more detail, we characterize the complexity of reasoning for some meaningful classes of evolving knowledge bases, ranging from polynomial to double exponential space complexity."

This introductory paper is concerned with general methodology. Its main goal is to explain why it is critically important for both neural modeling and cognitive modeling to pay much attention to the basic requirements of the whole brain as a complex computing system. The author argues that it can be easier to develop an adequate computational model for the whole \"unprogrammed\" (untrained) human brain than to find adequate formal representations of some nontrivial parts of brain's performance. (In the same way as, for example, it is easier to describe the behavior of a complex analytical function than the behavior of its real and/or imaginary part.) The \"curse of dimensionality\" that plagues purely phenomenological (\"brainless\") cognitive theories is a natural penalty for an attempt to represent insufficiently large parts of brain's performance in a state space of insufficiently high dimensionality.

To speed up learning, one often used solution is the integration of planning, for example, Sutton's Dyna algorithm, or various other methods using macro-actions.   Here we suggest to separate plannable, i.e., close to deterministic parts of the world, and focus planning efforts in this domain. A novel reinforcement learning method called plannable RL (pRL) is proposed here. pRL builds a simple model, which is used to search for macro actions. The simplicity of the model makes planning computationally inexpensive. It is shown that pRL finds an optimal policy, and that plannable macro actions found by pRL are near-optimal. In turn, it is unnecessary to try large numbers of macro actions, which enables fast learning. The utility of pRL is demonstrated by computer simulations."

The identification of sub-problems of this nature may promote e.g., planning, scheduling and segmenting Markov decision processes. In this work, formulae for the average duration as well as the standard deviation of the duration of events are derived.

In DeLP an argumentation formalism will be used for deciding between contradictory goals. Queries will be supported by arguments that could be defeated by other arguments. A query q will succeed when there is an argument A for q that is warranted, ie, the argument A that supports q is found undefeated by a warrant procedure that implements a dialectical analysis.

The unfolding is done in two separate steps. Firstly, it is shown that partial stable models can be captured by total stable models using a simple linear and modular program transformation. Hence, reasoning tasks concerning partial stable models can be solved using an implementation of total stable models. Disjunctive partial stable models have been lacking implementations which now become available as the translation handles also the disjunctive case. Secondly, it is shown how total stable models of disjunctive programs can be determined by computing stable models for normal programs. Hence, an implementation of stable models of normal programs can be used as a core engine for implementing disjunctive programs. The feasibility of the approach is demonstrated by constructing a system for computing stable models of disjunctive programs using the smodels system as the core engine. The performance of the resulting system is compared to that of dlv which is a state-of-the-art special purpose system for disjunctive programs."

    "title": "Multi-target particle filtering for the probability hypothesis density",
    "abstract": "When tracking a large number of targets, it is often computationally expensive to represent the full joint distribution over target states. In cases where the targets move independently, each target can instead be tracked with a separate filter. However, this leads to a model-data association problem. Another approach to solve the problem with computational complexity is to track only the first moment of the joint distribution, the probability hypothesis density (PHD). The integral of this distribution over any area S is the expected number of targets within S. Since no record of object identity is kept, the model-data association problem is avoided.   The contribution of this paper is a particle filter implementation of the PHD filter mentioned above. This PHD particle filter is applied to tracking of multiple vehicles in terrain, a non-linear tracking problem. Experiments show that the filter can track a changing number of vehicles robustly, achieving near-real-time performance."

    "abstract": "Search in cyclic AND/OR graphs was traditionally known to be an unsolved problem. In the recent past several important studies have been reported in this domain. In this paper, we have taken a fresh look at the problem. First, a new and comprehensive theoretical framework for cyclic AND/OR graphs has been presented, which was found missing in the recent literature. Based on this framework, two best-first search algorithms, S1 and S2, have been developed. S1 does uninformed search and is a simple modification of the Bottom-up algorithm by Martelli and Montanari. S2 performs a heuristically guided search and replicates the modification in Bottom-up's successors, namely HS and AO*. Both S1 and S2 solve the problem of searching AND/OR graphs in presence of cycles. We then present a detailed analysis for the correctness and complexity results of S1 and S2, using the proposed framework. We have observed through experiments that S1 and S2 output correct results in all cases."

    "abstract": "Thomas M. Strat has developed a decision-theoretic apparatus for Dempster-Shafer theory (Decision analysis using belief functions, Intern. J. Approx. Reason. 4(5/6), 391-417, 1990). In this apparatus, expected utility intervals are constructed for different choices. The choice with the highest expected utility is preferable to others. However, to find the preferred choice when the expected utility interval of one choice is included in that of another, it is necessary to interpolate a discerning point in the intervals. This is done by the parameter rho, defined as the probability that the ambiguity about the utility of every nonsingleton focal element will turn out as favorable as possible. If there are several different decision makers, we might sometimes be more interested in having the highest expected utility among the decision makers rather than only trying to maximize our own expected utility regardless of choices made by other decision makers. The preference of each choice is then determined by the probability of yielding the highest expected utility. This probability is equal to the maximal interval length of rho under which an alternative is preferred. We must here take into account not only the choices already made by other decision makers but also the rational choices we can assume to be made by later decision makers. In Strats apparatus, an assumption, unwarranted by the evidence at hand, has to be made about the value of rho. We demonstrate that no such assumption is necessary. It is sufficient to assume a uniform probability distribution for rho to be able to discern the most preferable choice. We discuss when this approach is justifiable."

    "title": "Updating beliefs with incomplete observations",
    "abstract": "Currently, there is renewed interest in the problem, raised by Shafer in 1985, of updating probabilities when observations are incomplete. This is a fundamental problem in general, and of particular interest for Bayesian networks. Recently, Grunwald and Halpern have shown that commonly used updating strategies fail in this case, except under very special assumptions. In this paper we propose a new method for updating probabilities with incomplete observations. Our approach is deliberately conservative: we make no assumptions about the so-called incompleteness mechanism that associates complete with incomplete observations. We model our ignorance about this mechanism by a vacuous lower prevision, a tool from the theory of imprecise probabilities, and we use only coherence arguments to turn prior into posterior probabilities. In general, this new approach to updating produces lower and upper posterior probabilities and expectations, as well as partially determinate decisions. This is a logical consequence of the existing ignorance about the incompleteness mechanism. We apply the new approach to the problem of classification of new evidence in probabilistic expert systems, where it leads to a new, so-called conservative updating rule. In the special case of Bayesian networks constructed using expert knowledge, we provide an exact algorithm for classification based on our updating rule, which has linear-time complexity for a class of networks wider than polytrees. This result is then extended to the more general framework of credal networks, where computations are often much harder than with Bayesian nets. Using an example, we show that our rule appears to provide a solid basis for reliable updating with incomplete observations, when no strong assumptions about the incompleteness mechanism are justified."

    "abstract": "As examples such as the Monty Hall puzzle show, applying conditioning to update a probability distribution on a ``naive space'', which does not take into account the protocol used, can often lead to counterintuitive results. Here we examine why. A criterion known as CAR (``coarsening at random'') in the statistical literature characterizes when ``naive'' conditioning in a naive space works. We show that the CAR condition holds rather infrequently, and we provide a procedural characterization of it, by giving a randomized algorithm that generates all and only distributions for which CAR holds. This substantially extends previous characterizations of CAR. We also consider more generalized notions of update such as Jeffrey conditioning and minimizing relative entropy (MRE). We give a generalization of the CAR condition that characterizes when Jeffrey conditioning leads to appropriate answers, and show that there exist some very simple settings in which MRE essentially never gives the right results. This generalizes and interconnects previous results obtained in the literature on CAR and MRE."

This highly combinatorial problem in the field of constraint programming has been addressed with a variety of approaches since the foundation system R1(McDermott82). An inherent difficulty in solving configuration problems is the existence of many isomorphisms among interpretations. We describe a formalism independent approach to improve the detection of isomorphisms by configurators, which does not require to adapt the problem model. To achieve this, we exploit the properties of a characteristic subset of configuration problems, called the structural sub-problem, which canonical solutions can be produced or tested at a limited cost. In this paper we present an algorithm for testing the canonicity of configurations, that can be added as a symmetry breaking constraint to any configurator. The cost and efficiency of this canonicity test are given."

A software model, SP61, has been developed for the discovery and formation of 'good' multiple alignments, evaluated in terms of information compression. The model is described in outline.   Using examples from the SP61 model, this article describes in outline how the ICMAUS framework can model various kinds of PR including: PR in best-match pattern recognition and information retrieval; one-step 'deductive' and 'abductive' PR; inheritance of attributes in a class hierarchy; chains of reasoning (probabilistic decision networks and decision trees, and PR with 'rules'); geometric analogy problems; nonmonotonic reasoning and reasoning with default values; modelling the function of a Bayesian network."

The importance of taking into account the interaction is shown with a real example providing an inconsistent knowledge base, whose inconsistency (a) cannot be detected by reasoning separately about each of the two components of the knowledge, just because, taken separately, each is consistent, but (b) is detected by the proposed algorithm, thanks to the interaction knowledge propagated from each of the two compnents to the other."

A d-line has two degrees of freedom (DFs): a rotational DF (RDF), and a translational DF (TDF). The representation of the RDF of a d-line will be handled by an RA of 2D orientations, CYC_t, known in the literature. A second algebra, TA_t, which will handle the TDF of a d-line, will be defined. The two algebras, CYC_t and TA_t, will constitute, respectively, the translational and the rotational components of the RA, PA_t, of relative position relations on d-lines: the PA_t atoms will consist of those pairs <t,r> of a TA_t atom and a CYC_t atom that are compatible. We present in detail the RA PA_t, with its converse table, its rotation table and its composition tables. We show that a (polynomial) constraint propagation algorithm, known in the literature, is complete for a subset of PA_t relations including almost all of the atomic relations. We will discuss the application scope of the RA, which includes incidence geometry, GIS (Geographic Information Systems), shape representation, localisation in (multi-)robot navigation, and the representation of motion prepositions in NLP (Natural Language Processing).

    "title": "From Statistical Knowledge Bases to Degrees of Belief",
    "abstract": "An intelligent agent will often be uncertain about various properties of its environment, and when acting in that environment it will frequently need to quantify its uncertainty. For example, if the agent wishes to employ the expected-utility paradigm of decision theory to guide its actions, it will need to assign degrees of belief (subjective probabilities) to various assertions. Of course, these degrees of belief should not be arbitrary, but rather should be based on the information available to the agent. This paper describes one approach for inducing degrees of belief from very rich knowledge bases, that can include information about particular individuals, statistical correlations, physical laws, and default rules. We call our approach the random-worlds method. The method is based on the principle of indifference: it treats all of the worlds the agent considers possible as being equally likely. It is able to integrate qualitative default reasoning with quantitative probabilistic reasoning by providing a language in which both types of information can be easily expressed. Our results show that a number of desiderata that arise in direct inference (reasoning from statistical information to conclusions about individuals) and default reasoning follow directly {from} the semantics of random worlds. For example, random worlds captures important patterns of reasoning such as specificity, inheritance, indifference to irrelevant information, and default assumptions of independence. Furthermore, the expressive power of the language used and the intuitive semantics of random worlds allow the method to deal with problems that are beyond the scope of many other non-deductive reasoning systems."

We apply interaction information to visually present the most important interactions of the data. Visualization of interactions has provided insight into the structure of data on a number of domains, identifying redundant attributes and opportunities for constructing new features, discovering unexpected regularities in data, and have helped during construction of predictive models; we illustrate the methods on numerous examples. A machine learning method that disregards interactions may get caught in two traps: myopia is caused by learning algorithms assuming independence in spite of interactions, whereas fragmentation arises from assuming an interaction in spite of independence."

In this paper we study abduction with penalization in the logic programming framework. This form of abductive reasoning, which has not been previously analyzed in logic programming, turns out to represent several relevant problems, including optimization problems, very naturally. We define a formal model for abduction with penalization over logic programs, which extends the abductive framework proposed by Kakas and Mancarella. We address knowledge representation issues, encoding a number of problems in our abductive framework. In particular, we consider some relevant problems, taken from different domains, ranging from optimization theory to diagnosis and planning; their encodings turn out to be simple and elegant in our formalism. We thoroughly analyze the computational complexity of the main problems arising in the context of abduction with penalization from logic programs. Finally, we implement a system supporting the proposed abductive framework on top of the DLV engine. To this end, we design a translation from abduction problems with penalties into logic programs with weak constraints. We prove that this approach is sound and complete."

This \"SP theory\", which has been under development since 1987, provides a unified view of such things as the workings of a universal Turing machine, the nature of 'knowledge', the interpretation and production of natural language, pattern recognition and best-match information retrieval, several kinds of probabilistic reasoning, planning and problem solving, unsupervised learning, and a range of concepts in mathematics and logic. The theory also provides a basis for the design of an 'SP' computer with several potential advantages compared with traditional digital computers."

    "abstract": "In rule-based systems, goal-oriented computations correspond naturally to the possible ways that an observation may be explained. In some applications, we need to compute explanations for a series of observations with the same domain. The question whether previously computed answers can be recycled arises. A yes answer could result in substantial savings of repeated computations. For systems based on classic logic, the answer is YES. For nonmonotonic systems however, one tends to believe that the answer should be NO, since recycling is a form of adding information. In this paper, we show that computed answers can always be recycled, in a nontrivial way, for the class of rewrite procedures that we proposed earlier for logic programs with negation. We present some experimental results on an encoding of the logistics domain."

These formal results led to a better understanding of issues of control and side-effects in functional and imperative languages. This framework can be successfully applied to the investigation of the performance of Artificial Intelligence (AI) inference and cognitive systems. In this paper, we delineate a categorical formalisation of memory as a control structure driving performance in inference systems. Abstracting away control mechanisms from three widely used representations of memory in cognitive systems (scripts, production rules and clusters) we explain how categorical triples capture the interaction between learning and problem-solving."

In recent years many successful ML applications have been developed, such as datamining programs, information-filtering systems, etc. Although ML algorithms allow the detection and extraction of interesting patterns of data for several kinds of problems, most of these algorithms are based on quantitative reasoning, as they rely on training data in order to infer so-called target functions.   In the last years defeasible argumentation has proven to be a sound setting to formalize common-sense qualitative reasoning. This approach can be combined with other inference techniques, such as those provided by machine learning theory.   In this paper we outline different alternatives for combining defeasible argumentation and machine learning techniques. We suggest how different aspects of a generic argument-based framework can be integrated with other ML-based approaches."

This approach relies mainly on the closed world assumption to complete the available knowledge and its formulation has its basis in the so-called Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation.   The primary goal of this work is to present an alternative and epistemic-based characterization of stable model semantics, to the Gelfond-Lifschitz transformation. In particular, we show that stable model semantics can be defined entirely as an extension of the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Indeed, we show that the closed world assumption can be seen as an additional source of `falsehood' to be added cumulatively to the Kripke-Kleene semantics. Our approach is purely algebraic and can abstract from the particular formalism of choice as it is based on monotone operators (under the knowledge order) over bilattices only."

Most of these hybridization approaches, however, follow an ad hoc design methodology, justified by success in certain application domains. Due to the lack of a common framework it often remains difficult to compare the various hybrid systems conceptually and to evaluate their performance comparatively. This chapter introduces the different generic architectures for integrating intelligent systems. The designing aspects and perspectives of different hybrid archirectures like NN-FIS, EC-FIS, EC-NN, FIS-PR and NN-FIS-EC systems are presented. Some conclusions are also provided towards the end."

In general, climate and rainfall are highly non-linear phenomena in nature exhibiting what is known as the butterfly effect. While some regions of the world are noticing a systematic decrease in annual rainfall, others notice increases in flooding and severe storms. The global nature of this phenomenon is very complicated and requires sophisticated computer modeling and simulation to predict accurately. In this paper, we report a performance analysis for Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS)and artificial neural networks for one month ahead prediction of rainfall. To evaluate the prediction efficiency, we made use of 87 years of rainfall data in Kerala state, the southern part of the Indian peninsula situated at latitude -longitude pairs (8o29'N - 76o57' E). We used an artificial neural network trained using the scaled conjugate gradient algorithm. The neural network and MARS were trained with 40 years of rainfall data.

Empirical results clearly show the superiority of the fuzzy technique in optimising individual objective functions when compared to non-fuzzy approach.

The largest compatible subset problem can be viewed as the vertex cover problem in the graph theory that has been proven to be NP-hard. In this paper, we propose a hybrid Evolutionary Computing (EC) method for this problem. The proposed method combines the EC approach and the algorithmic approach for special structured graphs. As a result, the complexity of the problem is dramatically reduced. Experiments were performed on randomly generated graphs with different edge densities. The vertex covers produced by the proposed method were then compared to the vertex covers produced by a 2-approximation algorithm.

The standard approach that has so far been employed in most chess programs is based on utilising positional matrices in original and compressed format as well as on the implementation of the so-called bitboard format.   The new approach that we will be trying to introduce is based on using variant strings generated by the search algorithm (searcher) during the tree expansion in decision making. We hope to prove that this approach is more efficient than the standard treatment of the issue, especially in positions with few pieces (endgames). To illustrate what we have in mind a machine language routine that implements our theoretical assumptions is attached. The routine is part of the Axon chess program, developed by the authors. Axon, in its current incarnation, plays chess at master strength (ca. 2400-2450 Elo, based on both Axon vs computer programs and Axon vs human masters in over 3000 games altogether)."

    "abstract": "Learning to respond to voice-text input involves the subject's ability in understanding the phonetic and text based contents and his/her ability to communicate based on his/her experience. The neuro-cognitive facility of the subject has to support two important domains in order to make the learning process complete. In many cases, though the understanding is complete, the response is partial. This is one valid reason why we need to support the information from the subject with scalable techniques such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) for abstraction of the contents from the output. This paper explores the feasibility of using NLP modules interlaced with Neural Networks to perform the required task in autogenic training related to medical applications."

The generation of subproblems is done through value ranking and domain splitting. Subdomains are explored so as to generate, according to the heuristic chosen, promising subproblems first.   We show that two well known search strategies, Limited Discrepancy Search (LDS) and Iterative Broadening (IB), can be seen as special cases of DBS. First we present a tuning of DBS that visits the same search nodes as IB, but avoids restarts. Then we compare both theoretically and computationally DBS and LDS using the same heuristic. We prove that DBS has a higher probability of being successful than LDS on a comparable number of nodes, under realistic assumptions. Experiments on a constraint satisfaction problem and an optimization problem show that DBS is indeed very effective if compared to LDS."

In this paper, we propose and analyse a very simple method to apply in case the value ordering heuristic produces ties: postponing the branching decision. To this end, we group together values in a tie, branch on this sub-domain, and defer the decision among them to lower levels of the search tree. We show theoretically and experimentally that this simple modification can dramatically improve the efficiency of the search strategy. Although in practise similar methods may have been applied already, to our knowledge, no empirical or theoretical study has been proposed in the literature to identify when and to what extent this strategy should be used."

It consists of a variable domain value ranking based on reduced costs. Exploiting the ranking, we generate, in a Limited Discrepancy Search tree, the most promising subproblems first. An interesting result is that reduced costs provide a very precise ranking that allows to almost always find the optimal solution in the first generated subproblem, even if its dimension is significantly smaller than that of the original problem. Concerning the proof of optimality, we exploit a way to increase the lower bound for subproblems at higher discrepancies. We show experimental results on the TSP and its time constrained variant to show the effectiveness of the proposed approach, but the technique could be generalized for other problems."

PCR1 and WAO are particular cases of WO (the Weighted Operator) because the conflicting mass is redistributed with respect to some weighting factors. In this first PCR rule, the proportionalization is done for each non-empty set with respect to the non-zero sum of its corresponding mass matrix - instead of its mass column average as in WAO, but the results are the same as Ph. Smets has pointed out. Also, we extend WAO (which herein gives no solution) for the degenerate case when all column sums of all non-empty sets are zero, and then the conflicting mass is transferred to the non-empty disjunctive form of all non-empty sets together; but if this disjunctive form happens to be empty, then one considers an open world (i.e. the frame of discernment might contain new hypotheses) and thus all conflicting mass is transferred to the empty set. In addition to WAO, we propose a general formula for PCR1 (WAO for non-degenerate cases)."

However, Boltzmann selection is not used in practice because a good annealing schedule for the `inverse temperature' parameter is lacking. In this paper we propose a Cauchy annealing schedule for Boltzmann selection scheme based on a hypothesis that selection-strength should increase as evolutionary process goes on and distance between two selection strengths should decrease for the process to converge. To formalize these aspects, we develop formalism for selection mechanisms using fitness distributions and give an appropriate measure for selection-strength. In this paper, we prove an important result, by which we derive an annealing schedule called Cauchy annealing schedule. We demonstrate the novelty of proposed annealing schedule using simulations in the framework of genetic algorithms."

From PCR1 to PCR2, PCR3, PCR4, PCR5 one increases the complexity of the rules and also the exactitude of the redistribution of conflicting masses. PCR1 restricted from the hyper-power set to the power set and without degenerate cases gives the same result as the Weighted Average Operator (WAO) proposed recently by J{\\o}sang, Daniel and Vannoorenberghe but does not satisfy the neutrality property of vacuous belief assignment. That's why improved PCR rules are proposed in this paper. PCR4 is an improvement of minC and Dempster's rules. The PCR rules redistribute the conflicting mass, after the conjunctive rule has been applied, proportionally with some functions depending on the masses assigned to their corresponding columns in the mass matrix. There are infinitely many ways these functions (weighting factors) can be chosen depending on the complexity one wants to deal with in specific applications and fusion systems. Any fusion combination rule is at some degree ad-hoc."

The first normal form, called the {\\em kernel} of the program, is useful for studying existence and number of answer sets. A kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics, which are those that directly affect the existence of answer sets. The body of rules is composed of negative literals only. Thus, the kernel form tends to be significantly more compact than other formulations. Also, it is possible to check consistency of kernel programs in terms of colorings of the Extended Dependency Graph program representation which we previously developed. The second normal form is called {\\em 3-kernel.} A 3-kernel program is composed of the atoms which are undefined in the Well-founded semantics. Rules in 3-kernel programs have at most two conditions, and each rule either belongs to a cycle, or defines a connection between cycles. 3-kernel programs may have positive conditions. The 3-kernel normal form is very useful for the static analysis of program consistency, i.e., the syntactic characterization of existence of answer sets. This result can be obtained thanks to a novel graph-like representation of programs, called Cycle Graph which presented in the companion article \\cite{Cos04b}."

If the table is to be populated through knowledge elicited from a domain expert then the sheer magnitude of the task forms a considerable cognitive barrier. In this paper we devise an algorithm to populate the CPT while easing the extent of knowledge acquisition. The input to the algorithm consists of a set of weights that quantify the relative strengths of the influences of the parent-nodes on the child-node, and a set of probability distributions the number of which grows only linearly with the number of associated parent-nodes. These are elicited from the domain expert. The set of probabilities are obtained by taking into consideration the heuristics that experts use while arriving at probabilistic estimations. The algorithm is used to populate the CPT by computing appropriate weighted sums of the elicited distributions. We invoke the methods of information geometry to demonstrate how these weighted sums capture the expert's judgemental strategy."

Apart from the tracking result, it is often important to know where the tracking fails, either to steer sensors to that part of the state-space, or to inform a human operator about the status and quality of the obtained information. An intuitive quality measure is the correlation between two tracking results based on uncorrelated observations. In the case of Bayesian trackers such a correlation measure could be the Kullback-Leibler difference.   We focus on a scenario with a large number of military units moving in some terrain. The units are observed by several types of sensors and \"meta-sensors\" with force aggregation capabilities. The sensors register units of different size. Two separate multi-target probability hypothesis density (PHD) particle filters are used to track some type of units (e.g., companies) and their sub-units (e.g., platoons), respectively, based on observations of units of those sizes. Each observation is used in one filter only.   Although the state-space may well be the same in both filters, the posterior PHD distributions are not directly comparable -- one unit might correspond to three or four spatially distributed sub-units. Therefore, we introduce a mapping function between distributions for different unit size, based on doctrine knowledge of unit configuration.   The mapped distributions can now be compared -- locally or globally -- using some measure, which gives the correlation between two PHD distributions in a bounded volume of the state-space. To locate areas where the tracking fails, a discretized quality map of the state-space can be generated by applying the measure locally to different parts of the space."

Here we consider the problem of pre-processing for multiple target tracking when the number of sensor reports received is very large and arrives in large bursts. In this case, it is sometimes necessary to pre-process reports before sending them to tracking modules in the fusion system. The pre-processing step associates reports to known tracks (or initializes new tracks for reports on objects that have not been seen before). It could also be used as a pre-process step before clustering, e.g., in order to test how many clusters to use.   The pre-processing is done by solving an approximate version of the original problem. In this approximation, not all pair-wise conflicts are calculated. The approximation relies on knowing how many such pair-wise conflicts that are necessary to compute. To determine this, results on phase-transitions occurring when coloring (or clustering) large random instances of a particular graph ensemble are used."

Many NP-complete problems can be encoded in the answer set semantics of logic programs in a very concise and intuitive way, where the encoding reflects the typical \"guess and check\" nature of NP problems: The property is encoded in a way such that polynomial size certificates for it correspond to stable models of a program. However, the problem-solving capacity of full disjunctive logic programs (DLPs) is beyond NP, and captures a class of problems at the second level of the polynomial hierarchy. While these problems also have a clear \"guess and check\" structure, finding an encoding in a DLP reflecting this structure may sometimes be a non-obvious task, in particular if the \"check\" itself is a coNP-complete problem; usually, such problems are solved by interleaving separate guess and check programs, where the check is expressed by inconsistency of the check program. In this paper, we present general transformations of head-cycle free (extended) disjunctive logic programs into stratified and positive (extended) disjunctive logic programs based on meta-interpretation techniques. The answer sets of the original and the transformed program are in simple correspondence, and, moreover, inconsistency of the original program is indicated by a designated answer set of the transformed program. Our transformations facilitate the integration of separate \"guess\" and \"check\" programs, which are often easy to obtain, automatically into a single disjunctive logic program. Our results complement recent results on meta-interpretation in ASP, and extend methods and techniques for a declarative \"guess and check\" problem solving paradigm through ASP."

    "abstract": "Bayesian averaging over classification models allows the uncertainty of classification outcomes to be evaluated, which is of crucial importance for making reliable decisions in applications such as financial in which risks have to be estimated. The uncertainty of classification is determined by a trade-off between the amount of data available for training, the diversity of a classifier ensemble and the required performance. The interpretability of classification models can also give useful information for experts responsible for making reliable classifications. For this reason Decision Trees (DTs) seem to be attractive classification models. The required diversity of the DT ensemble can be achieved by using the Bayesian model averaging all possible DTs. In practice, the Bayesian approach can be implemented on the base of a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) technique of random sampling from the posterior distribution. For sampling large DTs, the MCMC method is extended by Reversible Jump technique which allows inducing DTs under given priors. For the case when the prior information on the DT size is unavailable, the sweeping technique defining the prior implicitly reveals a better performance. Within this Chapter we explore the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian MCMC techniques on some datasets from the StatLog Repository and real financial data. The classification uncertainty is compared within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability. This technique provides realistic estimates of the classification uncertainty which can be easily interpreted in statistical terms with the aim of risk evaluation."

The required diversity of MCSs exploiting such classification models can be achieved by using two techniques, the Bayesian model averaging and the randomised DT ensemble. Both techniques have revealed promising results when applied to real-world problems. In this paper we experimentally compare the classification uncertainty of the Bayesian model averaging with a restarting strategy and the randomised DT ensemble on a synthetic dataset and some domain problems commonly used in the machine learning community. To make the Bayesian DT averaging feasible, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo technique. The classification uncertainty is evaluated within an Uncertainty Envelope technique dealing with the class posterior distribution and a given confidence probability.

    "abstract": "In the frame of designing a knowledge discovery system, we have developed stochastic models based on high-order hidden Markov models. These models are capable to map sequences of data into a Markov chain in which the transitions between the states depend on the \\texttt{n} previous states according to the order of the model. We study the process of achieving information extraction fromspatial and temporal data by means of an unsupervised classification. We use therefore a French national database related to the land use of a region, named Teruti, which describes the land use both in the spatial and temporal domain. Land-use categories (wheat, corn, forest, ...) are logged every year on each site regularly spaced in the region. They constitute a temporal sequence of images in which we look for spatial and temporal dependencies. The temporal segmentation of the data is done by means of a second-order Hidden Markov Model (\\hmmd) that appears to have very good capabilities to locate stationary segments, as shown in our previous work in speech recognition. Thespatial classification is performed by defining a fractal scanning ofthe images with the help of a Hilbert-Peano curve that introduces atotal order on the sites, preserving the relation ofneighborhood between the sites. We show that the \\hmmd performs aclassification that is meaningful for the agronomists.Spatial and temporal classification may be achieved simultaneously by means of a 2 levels \\hmmd that measures the \\aposteriori probability to map a temporal sequence of images onto a set of hidden classes."

    "abstract": "Our ongoing work aims at defining an ontology-centered approach for building expertise models for the CommonKADS methodology. This approach (which we have named \"OntoKADS\") is founded on a core problem-solving ontology which distinguishes between two conceptualization levels: at an object level, a set of concepts enable us to define classes of problem-solving situations, and at a meta level, a set of meta-concepts represent modeling primitives. In this article, our presentation of OntoKADS will focus on the core ontology and, in particular, on roles - the primitive situated at the interface between domain knowledge and reasoning, and whose ontological status is still much debated. We first propose a coherent, global, ontological framework which enables us to account for this primitive. We then show how this novel characterization of the primitive allows definition of new rules for the construction of expertise models."

The original ATNoSFERES, using a bitstring to represent the language tokens, has been favorably compared in previous work to several Michigan style LCSs architectures in the context of Non Markov problems. Several modifications of ATNoSFERES are proposed here: the most important one conceptually being a representational change: each token is now represented by an integer, hence the genotype is a string of integers; several other modifications of the underlying grammar language are also proposed. The resulting ATNoSFERES-II is validated on several standard animat Non Markov problems, on which it outperforms all previously published results in the LCS literature. The reasons for these improvement are carefully analyzed, and some assumptions are proposed on the underlying mechanisms in order to explain these good results."

    "abstract": "Clustering is a widely used technique in data mining applications for discovering patterns in underlying data. Most traditional clustering algorithms are limited to handling datasets that contain either numeric or categorical attributes. However, datasets with mixed types of attributes are common in real life data mining applications. In this paper, we propose a novel divide-and-conquer technique to solve this problem. First, the original mixed dataset is divided into two sub-datasets: the pure categorical dataset and the pure numeric dataset. Next, existing well established clustering algorithms designed for different types of datasets are employed to produce corresponding clusters. Last, the clustering results on the categorical and numeric dataset are combined as a categorical dataset, on which the categorical data clustering algorithm is used to get the final clusters. Our contribution in this paper is to provide an algorithm framework for the mixed attributes clustering problem, in which existing clustering algorithms can be easily integrated, the capabilities of different kinds of clustering algorithms and characteristics of different types of datasets could be fully exploited. Comparisons with other clustering algorithms on real life datasets illustrate the superiority of our approach."

The methodology relies on a set of rigorously-defined modelling primitives and principles. Its application leads to the elaboration of a semi-informal ontology, which is independent of knowledge representation languages. We recently enriched the OntoSpec methodology by endowing it with a new resource, the DOLCE top-level ontology defined at the LOA (IST-CNR, Trento, Italy). The goal of this integration is to provide modellers with additional help in structuring application ontologies, while maintaining independence vis-\\`{a}-vis formal representation languages. In this report, we first provide an overview of the OntoSpec methodology's general principles and then describe the DOLCE re-engineering process.

We focus on the particular problem of local reconstruction of the schedule following a small perturbation, seeking minimisation of the total accumulated delay by adapting times of departure and arrival for each train and allocation of resources (tracks, routing nodes, etc.). We describe a permutation-based evolutionary algorithm that relies on a semi-greedy heuristic to gradually reconstruct the schedule by inserting trains one after the other following the permutation. This algorithm can be hybridised with ILOG commercial MIP programming tool CPLEX in a coarse-grained manner: the evolutionary part is used to quickly obtain a good but suboptimal solution and this intermediate solution is refined using CPLEX. Experimental results are presented on a large real-world case involving more than one million variables and 2 million constraints. Results are surprisingly good as the evolutionary algorithm, alone or hybridised, produces excellent solutions much faster than CPLEX alone."

Among the most successful methods to automate the fuzzy controllers development process are evolutionary algorithms. In this work, we propose the Recurrent Fuzzy Voronoi (RFV) model, a representation for recurrent fuzzy systems. It is an extension of the FV model proposed by Kavka and Schoenauer that extends the application domain to include temporal problems. The FV model is a representation for fuzzy controllers based on Voronoi diagrams that can represent fuzzy systems with synergistic rules, fulfilling the $\\epsilon$-completeness property and providing a simple way to introduce a priory knowledge. In the proposed representation, the temporal relations are embedded by including internal units that provide feedback by connecting outputs to inputs. These internal units act as memory elements. In the RFV model, the semantic of the internal units can be specified together with the a priori rules. The geometric interpretation of the rules allows the use of geometric variational operators during the evolution. The representation and the algorithms are validated in two problems in the area of system identification and evolutionary robotics."

    "abstract": "When solving numerical constraints such as nonlinear equations and inequalities, solvers often exploit pruning techniques, which remove redundant value combinations from the domains of variables, at pruning steps. To find the complete solution set, most of these solvers alternate the pruning steps with branching steps, which split each problem into subproblems. This forms the so-called branch-and-prune framework, well known among the approaches for solving numerical constraints. The basic branch-and-prune search strategy that uses domain bisections in place of the branching steps is called the bisection search. In general, the bisection search works well in case (i) the solutions are isolated, but it can be improved further in case (ii) there are continuums of solutions (this often occurs when inequalities are involved). In this paper, we propose a new branch-and-prune search strategy along with several variants, which not only allow yielding better branching decisions in the latter case, but also work as well as the bisection search does in the former case. These new search algorithms enable us to employ various pruning techniques in the construction of inner and outer approximations of the solution set. Our experiments show that these algorithms speed up the solving process often by one order of magnitude or more when solving problems with continuums of solutions, while keeping the same performance as the bisection search when the solutions are isolated."

We show how to construct a cluster information criterion that allows objective model selection. Differing from other approaches, our truecluster method does not require specific assumptions about underlying distributions, dissimilarity definitions or cluster models. Truecluster puts arbitrary clustering algorithms into a generic unified (sampling-based) statistical framework.

But the most prominent advantage of the Divide-and-Evolve approach is that it immediately opens up an avenue for multi-objective optimization, even though the OR method that is used is single-objective. Proof of concept approach on the standard (single-objective) Zeno transportation benchmark is given, and a small original multi-objective benchmark is proposed in the same Zeno framework to assess the multi-objective capabilities of the proposed methodology, a breakthrough in Temporal Planning."

Many such problems arising from the commercial world are permeated by data uncertainty. Existing CP approaches that accommodate uncertainty are less suited to uncertainty arising due to incomplete and erroneous data, because they do not build reliable models and solutions guaranteed to address the user's genuine problem as she perceives it. Other fields such as reliable computation offer combinations of models and associated methods to handle these types of uncertain data, but lack an expressive framework characterising the resolution methodology independently of the model.   We present a unifying framework that extends the CP formalism in both model and solutions, to tackle ill-defined combinatorial problems with incomplete or erroneous data. The certainty closure framework brings together modelling and solving methodologies from different fields into the CP paradigm to provide reliable and efficient approches for uncertain constraint problems. We demonstrate the applicability of the framework on a case study in network diagnosis. We define resolution forms that give generic templates, and their associated operational semantics, to derive practical solution methods for reliable solutions."

We define a fixed point logic (FPL) extension of Clark's completion such that open answer sets correspond to models of FPL formulas and identify a syntactic subclass of programs, called (loosely) guarded programs. Whereas reasoning with general programs in OASP is undecidable, the FPL translation of (loosely) guarded programs falls in the decidable (loosely) guarded fixed point logic (mu(L)GF). Moreover, we reduce normal closed ASP to loosely guarded OASP, enabling for the first time, a characterization of an answer set semantics by muLGF formulas. We further extend the open answer set semantics for programs with generalized literals. Such generalized programs (gPs) have interesting properties, e.g., the ability to express infinity axioms. We restrict the syntax of gPs such that both rules and generalized literals are guarded. Via a translation to guarded fixed point logic, we deduce 2-exptime-completeness of satisfiability checking in such guarded gPs (GgPs). Bound GgPs are restricted GgPs with exptime-complete satisfiability checking, but still sufficiently expressive to optimally simulate computation tree logic (CTL).

In this contribution, we discuss the estimation of the model when confounding latent variables are present. Although in this case uniqueness is no longer guaranteed, there is at most a finite set of models which can fit the data. We develop an algorithm for estimating this set, and describe numerical simulations which confirm the theoretical arguments and demonstrate the practical viability of the approach.

In this paper, we introduce a somewhat general formal model of computing with (some special) words. The new features of the model are that the input alphabet only comprises some (not necessarily all) fuzzy subsets of a set of symbols and the fuzzy transition function can be specified arbitrarily. By employing the methodology of fuzzy control, we establish a retraction principle from computing with words to computing with values for handling crisp inputs and a generalized extension principle from computing with words to computing with all words for handling fuzzy inputs. These principles show that computing with values and computing with all words can be respectively implemented by computing with words.

This calls for tools and methods for building an advanced information-processing infrastructure. One issue in this area is the selection of suitable information sources in query answering. In this paper, we present a knowledge-based approach to this problem, in the setting where one among a set of information sources (prototypically, data repositories) should be selected for evaluating a user query. We use extended logic programs (ELPs) to represent rich descriptions of the information sources, an underlying domain theory, and user queries in a formal query language (here, XML-QL, but other languages can be handled as well). Moreover, we use ELPs for declarative query analysis and generation of a query description. Central to our approach are declarative source-selection programs, for which we define syntax and semantics. Due to the structured nature of the considered data items, the semantics of such programs must carefully respect implicit context information in source-selection rules, and furthermore combine it with possible user preferences. A prototype implementation of our approach has been realized exploiting the DLV KR system and its plp front-end for prioritized ELPs. We describe a representative example involving specific movie databases, and report about experimental results."

In order to understand the role of perspective alignment and the cognitive processes involved, we have made precise complete cognitive models of situated embodied agents that self-organise a communication system for dialoging about the position and movement of real world objects in their immediate surroundings. We show in a series of robotic experiments which cognitive mechanisms are necessary and sufficient to achieve successful spatial language and why and how perspective alignment can take place, either implicitly or based on explicit marking."

    "abstract": "Computing and storing probabilities is a hard problem as soon as one has to deal with complex distributions over multiple random variables. The problem of efficient representation of probability distributions is central in term of computational efficiency in the field of probabilistic reasoning. The main problem arises when dealing with joint probability distributions over a set of random variables: they are always represented using huge probability arrays. In this paper, a new method based on binary-tree representation is introduced in order to store efficiently very large joint distributions. Our approach approximates any multidimensional joint distributions using an adaptive discretization of the space. We make the assumption that the lower is the probability mass of a particular region of feature space, the larger is the discretization step. This assumption leads to a very optimized representation in term of time and memory. The other advantages of our approach are the ability to refine dynamically the distribution every time it is needed leading to a more accurate representation of the probability distribution and to an anytime representation of the distribution."

(2) Through the construction of observability-based diagnosers of FDESs, we investigate its some basic properties. In particular, we present a necessary and sufficient condition for diagnosability of FDESs. (3) Some examples serving to illuminate the applications of the diagnosability of FDESs are described.

In Subjective Logic beliefs are expressed as belief mass distribution functions over binary frames of discernment. Belief representations in Subjective Logic, which are called opinions, also contain a base rate parameter which express the a priori belief in the absence of evidence. Philosophically, beliefs are quantitative representations of evidence as perceived by humans or by other intelligent agents. The basic operators of classical probability calculus, such as addition and multiplication, can be applied to opinions, thereby making belief calculus practical. Through the equivalence between opinions and Beta probability density functions, this also provides a calculus for Beta probability density functions.

In this paper we present a generalisation of the consensus operator that can be applied to Dirichlet belief functions on state spaces of arbitrary size. This rule, called the cumulative rule of belief combination, can be derived from classical statistical theory, and corresponds well with human intuition."

Traditionally, an operator uses the relative abundance of ions with specific mass-to-charge (m/z) ratios to categorize spectra. An operator does this by comparing the spectrum of m/z versus abundance of an unknown sample against a library of spectra from known samples. Automated positioning and acquisition allow I^2LD-FTMS to acquire data from very large grids, this would require classification of up to 3600 spectrum per hour to keep pace with the acquisition. The tedious job of classifying numerous spectra generated in an I^2LD-FTMS imaging application can be replaced by a fuzzy rule base if the cues an operator uses can be encapsulated. We present the translation of linguistic rules to a fuzzy classifier for mineral phases in basalt. This paper also describes a method for gathering statistics on ions, which are not currently used in the rule base, but which may be candidates for making the rule base more accurate and complete or to form new rule bases based on data obtained from known samples. A spatial method for classifying spectra with low membership values, based on neighboring sample classifications, is also presented."

The DLs that deal with such fuzzy concepts are called fuzzy DLs. In order to deal with fuzzy, incomplete, indeterminate and inconsistent concepts, we need to extend the fuzzy DLs, combining the neutrosophic logic with a classical DL.

Such a perspective allows us to explain seamlessly a variety of natural factors, factors ranging from the rise and presence of the human mind, man's sense of I, his self-consciousness and his looping thought processes to factors like reproduction, incubation, extinction, sleep, the richness of natural behavior, etc. It even allows us to speculate on a possible human evolution scenario and other natural phenomena."

    "abstract": "A product configurator which is complete, backtrack free and able to compute the valid domains at any state of the configuration can be constructed by building a Binary Decision Diagram (BDD). Despite the fact that the size of the BDD is exponential in the number of variables in the worst case, BDDs have proved to work very well in practice. Current BDD-based techniques can only handle interactive configuration with small finite domains. In this paper we extend the approach to handle string variables constrained by regular expressions. The user is allowed to change the strings by adding letters at the end of the string. We show how to make a data structure that can perform fast valid domain computations given some assignment on the set of string variables.   We first show how to do this by using one large DFA. Since this approach is too space consuming to be of practical use, we construct a data structure that simulates the large DFA and in most practical cases are much more space efficient. As an example a configuration problem on $n$ string variables with only one solution in which each string variable is assigned to a value of length of $k$ the former structure will use $\\Omega(k^n)$ space whereas the latter only need $O(kn)$. We also show how this framework easily can be combined with the recent BDD techniques to allow both boolean, integer and string variables in the configuration problem."

    "abstract": "Recently, M. Chertkov and V.Y. Chernyak derived an exact expression for the partition sum (normalization constant) corresponding to a graphical model, which is an expansion around the Belief Propagation solution. By adding correction terms to the BP free energy, one for each \"generalized loop\" in the factor graph, the exact partition sum is obtained. However, the usually enormous number of generalized loops generally prohibits summation over all correction terms. In this article we introduce Truncated Loop Series BP (TLSBP), a particular way of truncating the loop series of M. Chertkov and V.Y. Chernyak by considering generalized loops as compositions of simple loops. We analyze the performance of TLSBP in different scenarios, including the Ising model, regular random graphs and on Promedas, a large probabilistic medical diagnostic system. We show that TLSBP often improves upon the accuracy of the BP solution, at the expense of increased computation time. We also show that the performance of TLSBP strongly depends on the degree of interaction between the variables. For weak interactions, truncating the series leads to significant improvements, whereas for strong interactions it can be ineffective, even if a high number of terms is considered."

    "abstract": "In Verification and in (optimal) AI Planning, a successful method is to formulate the application as boolean satisfiability (SAT), and solve it with state-of-the-art DPLL-based procedures. There is a lack of understanding of why this works so well. Focussing on the Planning context, we identify a form of problem structure concerned with the symmetrical or asymmetrical nature of the cost of achieving the individual planning goals. We quantify this sort of structure with a simple numeric parameter called AsymRatio, ranging between 0 and 1. We run experiments in 10 benchmark domains from the International Planning Competitions since 2000; we show that AsymRatio is a good indicator of SAT solver performance in 8 of these domains. We then examine carefully crafted synthetic planning domains that allow control of the amount of structure, and that are clean enough for a rigorous analysis of the combinatorial search space. The domains are parameterized by size, and by the amount of structure. The CNFs we examine are unsatisfiable, encoding one planning step less than the length of the optimal plan. We prove upper and lower bounds on the size of the best possible DPLL refutations, under different settings of the amount of structure, as a function of size. We also identify the best possible sets of branching variables (backdoors). With minimum AsymRatio, we prove exponential lower bounds, and identify minimal backdoors of size linear in the number of variables. With maximum AsymRatio, we identify logarithmic DPLL refutations (and backdoors), showing a doubly exponential gap between the two structural extreme cases. The reasons for this behavior -- the proof arguments -- illuminate the prototypical patterns of structure causing the empirical behavior observed in the competition benchmarks."

    "abstract": "Constraint Programming (CP) has been successfully applied to both constraint satisfaction and constraint optimization problems. A wide variety of specialized global constraints provide critical assistance in achieving a good model that can take advantage of the structure of the problem in the search for a solution. However, a key outstanding issue is the representation of 'ad-hoc' constraints that do not have an inherent combinatorial nature, and hence are not modeled well using narrowly specialized global constraints. We attempt to address this issue by considering a hybrid of search and compilation. Specifically we suggest the use of Reduced Ordered Multi-Valued Decision Diagrams (ROMDDs) as the supporting data structure for a generic global constraint. We give an algorithm for maintaining generalized arc consistency (GAC) on this constraint that amortizes the cost of the GAC computation over a root-to-leaf path in the search tree without requiring asymptotically more space than used for the MDD. Furthermore we present an approach for incrementally maintaining the reduced property of the MDD during the search, and show how this can be used for providing domain entailment detection. Finally we discuss how to apply our approach to other similar data structures such as AOMDDs and Case DAGs. The technique used can be seen as an extension of the GAC algorithm for the regular language constraint on finite length input."

However, knowledge fusion or revision, is a common operation performed when users merge several different data sets in a unique decision making process, without much support. Introducing logics would be a great improvement, and we propose in this paper, means for deciding -a priori- if one application can benefit from a complete revision, under only the assumption of a conjecture that we name the \"containment conjecture\", which limits the size of the minimal conflicts to revise. We demonstrate that this conjecture brings us the interesting computational property of performing a not-provable but global, revision, made of many local revisions, at a tractable size.

Unfortunately, their performance is not always satisfactory when proteins are in the 'twilight zone'. We present HMMER-STRUCT, a model construction algorithm and tool that tries to improve pHMM performance by using structural information while training pHMMs. As a first step, HMMER-STRUCT constructs a set of pHMMs. Each pHMM is constructed by weighting each residue in an aligned protein according to a specific structural property of the residue. Properties used were primary, secondary and tertiary structures, accessibility and packing. HMMER-STRUCT then prioritizes the results by voting. Results: We used the SCOP database to perform our experiments. Throughout, we apply leave-one-family-out cross-validation over protein superfamilies. First, we used the MAMMOTH-mult structural aligner to align the training set proteins. Then, we performed two sets of experiments. In a first experiment, we compared structure weighted models against standard pHMMs and against each other. In a second experiment, we compared the voting model against individual pHMMs. We compare method performance through ROC curves and through Precision/Recall curves, and assess significance through the paired two tailed t-test. Our results show significant performance improvements of all structurally weighted models over default HMMER, and a significant improvement in sensitivity of the combined models over both the original model and the structurally weighted models."

Ensemble Learning with Evolutionary Computation thus receives increasing attention. The Evolutionary Ensemble Learning (EEL) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. First, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. Further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. This criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (Off-line) or incrementally along evolution (On-line). Experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that Off-line outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art Boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles."

With this wider scope of understanding, an agent can in learn to bluff its opponents, with the action representing not an illogical action, as bluffing is often viewed, but rather as an act of maximising returns through an effective statistical optimisation. By using a tee dee lambda learning algorithm to continuously adapt neural network agent intelligence, agents have been shown to be able to learn to bluff without outside prompting, and even to learn to call each others bluffs in free, competitive play."

The optimization of the controller is done using the NEAT algorithm, that optimizes both the topology and the weights of the Neural Networks. Though each cell only receives local information from its neighbors, the experimental results of the proposed approach on the 'flags' problems (the phenotype must match a given 2D pattern) are almost as good as those of a direct regression approach using the same model with global information.

The classic approach is to minimize the euclidean distance between two cluster solutions which induces inappropriate stability in certain settings. Therefore, we present the truematch algorithm that introduces two improvements best explained in the crisp case. First, instead of maximizing the trace of the cluster crosstable, we propose to maximize a chi-square transformation of this crosstable. Thus, the trace will not be dominated by the cells with the largest counts but by the cells with the most non-random observations, taking into account the marginals. Second, we suggest a probabilistic component in order to break ties and to make the matching algorithm truly random on random data. The truematch algorithm is designed as a building block of the truecluster framework and scales in polynomial time. First simulation results confirm that the truematch algorithm gives more consistent truecluster results for unequal cluster sizes. Free R software is available."

We show how the three constraints of genericity, domain semantic awareness and performance can be handled all together."

    "title": "Mixed Integer Linear Programming For Exact Finite-Horizon Planning In Decentralized Pomdps",
    "abstract": "We consider the problem of finding an n-agent joint-policy for the optimal finite-horizon control of a decentralized Pomdp (Dec-Pomdp). This is a problem of very high complexity (NEXP-hard in n >= 2). In this paper, we propose a new mathematical programming approach for the problem. Our approach is based on two ideas: First, we represent each agent's policy in the sequence-form and not in the tree-form, thereby obtaining a very compact representation of the set of joint-policies. Second, using this compact representation, we solve this problem as an instance of combinatorial optimization for which we formulate a mixed integer linear program (MILP). The optimal solution of the MILP directly yields an optimal joint-policy for the Dec-Pomdp. Computational experience shows that formulating and solving the MILP requires significantly less time to solve benchmark Dec-Pomdp problems than existing algorithms. For example, the multi-agent tiger problem for horizon 4 is solved in 72 secs with the MILP whereas existing algorithms require several hours to solve it."

Here we look back at important milestones of AI history, mention essential recent results, and speculate about what we may expect from the next 25 years, emphasizing the significance of the ongoing dramatic hardware speedups, and discussing Goedel-inspired, self-referential, self-improving universal problem solvers."

    "abstract": "Many systems can be described in terms of networks of discrete elements and their various relationships to one another. A semantic network, or multi-relational network, is a directed labeled graph consisting of a heterogeneous set of entities connected by a heterogeneous set of relationships. Semantic networks serve as a promising general-purpose modeling substrate for complex systems. Various standardized formats and tools are now available to support practical, large-scale semantic network models. First, the Resource Description Framework (RDF) offers a standardized semantic network data model that can be further formalized by ontology modeling languages such as RDF Schema (RDFS) and the Web Ontology Language (OWL). Second, the recent introduction of highly performant triple-stores (i.e. semantic network databases) allows semantic network models on the order of $10^9$ edges to be efficiently stored and manipulated. RDF and its related technologies are currently used extensively in the domains of computer science, digital library science, and the biological sciences. This article will provide an introduction to RDF/RDFS/OWL and an examination of its suitability to model discrete element complex systems."

    "abstract": "This paper deals with enriched qualitative belief functions for reasoning under uncertainty and for combining information expressed in natural language through linguistic labels. In this work, two possible enrichments (quantitative and/or qualitative) of linguistic labels are considered and operators (addition, multiplication, division, etc) for dealing with them are proposed and explained. We denote them $qe$-operators, $qe$ standing for \"qualitative-enriched\" operators. These operators can be seen as a direct extension of the classical qualitative operators ($q$-operators) proposed recently in the Dezert-Smarandache Theory of plausible and paradoxist reasoning (DSmT). $q$-operators are also justified in details in this paper. The quantitative enrichment of linguistic label is a numerical supporting degree in $[0,\\infty)$, while the qualitative enrichment takes its values in a finite ordered set of linguistic values. Quantitative enrichment is less precise than qualitative enrichment, but it is expected more close with what human experts can easily provide when expressing linguistic labels with supporting degrees. Two simple examples are given to show how the fusion of qualitative-enriched belief assignments can be done."

In a series of models, Models 1-4, we consider cognitive systems with increasing complexity of psychological behavior determined by structure of flows of ideas. Since our models are in fact models of the AI-type, one immediately recognizes that they can be used for creation of AI-systems, which we call psycho-robots, exhibiting important elements of human psyche. Creation of such psycho-robots may be useful improvement of domestic robots. At the moment domestic robots are merely simple working devices (e.g. vacuum cleaners or lawn mowers) . However, in future one can expect demand in systems which be able not only perform simple work tasks, but would have elements of human self-developing psyche. Such AI-psyche could play an important role both in relations between psycho-robots and their owners as well as between psycho-robots. Since the presence of a huge numbers of psycho-complexes is an essential characteristic of human psychology, it would be interesting to model them in the AI-framework."

    "abstract": "In this paper we study cellular automata (CAs) that perform the computational Majority task. This task is a good example of what the phenomenon of emergence in complex systems is. We take an interest in the reasons that make this particular fitness landscape a difficult one. The first goal is to study the landscape as such, and thus it is ideally independent from the actual heuristics used to search the space. However, a second goal is to understand the features a good search technique for this particular problem space should possess. We statistically quantify in various ways the degree of difficulty of searching this landscape. Due to neutrality, investigations based on sampling techniques on the whole landscape are difficult to conduct. So, we go exploring the landscape from the top. Although it has been proved that no CA can perform the task perfectly, several efficient CAs for this task have been found. Exploiting similarities between these CAs and symmetries in the landscape, we define the Olympus landscape which is regarded as the ''heavenly home'' of the best local optima known (blok). Then we measure several properties of this subspace. Although it is easier to find relevant CAs in this subspace than in the overall landscape, there are structural reasons that prevent a searcher from finding overfitted CAs in the Olympus. Finally, we study dynamics and performance of genetic algorithms on the Olympus in order to confirm our analysis and to find efficient CAs for the Majority problem with low computational cost."

    "abstract": "We develop a general framework for MAP estimation in discrete and Gaussian graphical models using Lagrangian relaxation techniques. The key idea is to reformulate an intractable estimation problem as one defined on a more tractable graph, but subject to additional constraints. Relaxing these constraints gives a tractable dual problem, one defined by a thin graph, which is then optimized by an iterative procedure. When this iterative optimization leads to a consistent estimate, one which also satisfies the constraints, then it corresponds to an optimal MAP estimate of the original model. Otherwise there is a ``duality gap'', and we obtain a bound on the optimal solution. Thus, our approach combines convex optimization with dynamic programming techniques applicable for thin graphs. The popular tree-reweighted max-product (TRMP) method may be seen as solving a particular class of such relaxations, where the intractable graph is relaxed to a set of spanning trees. We also consider relaxations to a set of small induced subgraphs, thin subgraphs (e.g. loops), and a connected tree obtained by ``unwinding'' cycles. In addition, we propose a new class of multiscale relaxations that introduce ``summary'' variables. The potential benefits of such generalizations include: reducing or eliminating the ``duality gap'' in hard problems, reducing the number or Lagrange multipliers in the dual problem, and accelerating convergence of the iterative optimization procedure."

Toward this end, we are developing the SWORIER system, which enables efficient automated reasoning on ontologies and rules, by translating all of them into Prolog and adding a set of general rules that properly capture the semantics of OWL. We have also enabled the user to make dynamic changes on the fly, at run time. This work addresses several of the concerns expressed in previous work, such as negation, complementary classes, disjunctive heads, and cardinality, and it discusses alternative approaches for dealing with inconsistencies in the knowledge base.

Analysis of the set of functions evolved allows to speculate that mobile localizations are likely to emerge in the quasi-chemical systems with limited diffusion of one reagent, a small number of molecules is required for amplification of travelling localizations, and reactions leading to stationary localizations involve relatively equal amount of quasi-chemical species. Techniques developed can be applied in cascading signals in nature-inspired spatially extended computing devices, and phenomenological studies and classification of non-linear discrete systems."

These are then mathematically formalised to produce a general measure of intelligence for arbitrary machines. We believe that this equation formally captures the concept of machine intelligence in the broadest reasonable sense. We then show how this formal definition is related to the theory of universal optimal learning agents.

We do not require that this probability distribution be computable, but it must be bounded below by a positive computable function. The agent has a utility function on outputs from the environment. We show that if this utility function is bounded below in absolute value by an unbounded computable function, then the expected utility of any input is undefined. This implies that a computable utility function will have convergent expected utilities iff that function is bounded."

And as domain knowledge is mainly conveyed through scientific and technical texts, we can hope to extract some useful information from them for building ontology. But is it as simple as this? In this article we shall see that the lexical structure, i.e. the network of words linked by linguistic relationships, does not necessarily match the domain conceptualization. We have to bear in mind that writing documents is the concern of textual linguistics, of which one of the principles is the incompleteness of text, whereas building ontology - viewed as task-independent knowledge - is concerned with conceptualization based on formal and not natural languages. Nevertheless, the famous Sapir and Whorf hypothesis, concerning the interdependence of thought and language, is also applicable to formal languages. This means that the way an ontology is built and a concept is defined depends directly on the formal language which is used; and the results will not be the same. The introduction of the notion of ontoterminology allows to take into account epistemological principles for formal ontology building."

The simulation would allow us to probe what would happen if we would \"replay the tape of the universe\" with the same or different laws and initial conditions. We also distinguish between real-world and artificial-world modelling. Assuming that intelligent life could indeed simulate an entire universe, this leads to two tentative hypotheses. Some authors have argued that we may already be in a simulation run by an intelligent entity. Or, if such a simulation could be made real, this would lead to the production of a new universe.

We present two selective pressure reducing strategies in order to slow down even more the best solution propagation. We experiment these strategies on a hard optimization problem, the quadratic assignment problem, and we show that there is a value for of the control parameter for both which gives the best performance. This optimal value does not find explanation on only the selective pressure, measured either by take over time and diversity evolution.

    "abstract": "Many social Web sites allow users to publish content and annotate with descriptive metadata. In addition to flat tags, some social Web sites have recently began to allow users to organize their content and metadata hierarchically. The social photosharing site Flickr, for example, allows users to group related photos in sets, and related sets in collections. The social bookmarking site Del.icio.us similarly lets users group related tags into bundles. Although the sites themselves don't impose any constraints on how these hierarchies are used, individuals generally use them to capture relationships between concepts, most commonly the broader/narrower relations. Collective annotation of content with hierarchical relations may lead to an emergent classification system, called a folksonomy. While some researchers have explored using tags as evidence for learning folksonomies, we believe that hierarchical relations described above offer a high-quality source of evidence for this task.   We propose a simple approach to aggregate shallow hierarchies created by many distinct Flickr users into a common folksonomy. Our approach uses statistics to determine if a particular relation should be retained or discarded. The relations are then woven together into larger hierarchies. Although we have not carried out a detailed quantitative evaluation of the approach, it looks very promising since it generates very reasonable, non-trivial hierarchies."

    "abstract": "In the last year more than 70,000 people have been brought to the UK hospitals with serious injuries. Each time a clinician has to urgently take a patient through a screening procedure to make a reliable decision on the trauma treatment. Typically, such procedure comprises around 20 tests; however the condition of a trauma patient remains very difficult to be tested properly. What happens if these tests are ambiguously interpreted, and information about the severity of the injury will come misleading? The mistake in a decision can be fatal: using a mild treatment can put a patient at risk of dying from posttraumatic shock, while using an overtreatment can also cause death. How can we reduce the risk of the death caused by unreliable decisions? It has been shown that probabilistic reasoning, based on the Bayesian methodology of averaging over decision models, allows clinicians to evaluate the uncertainty in decision making. Based on this methodology, in this paper we aim at selecting the most important screening tests, keeping a high performance. We assume that the probabilistic reasoning within the Bayesian methodology allows us to discover new relationships between the screening tests and uncertainty in decisions. In practice, selection of the most informative tests can also reduce the cost of a screening procedure in trauma care centers. In our experiments we use the UK Trauma data to compare the efficiency of the proposed technique in terms of the performance. We also compare the uncertainty in decisions in terms of entropy."

The first approach is certainly the better, but not always feasible. It is difficult to say which approach is the best between the second and the third. However, the most important is the produced results in applications. We propose here a new combination rule that distributes the conflict proportionally on the element given this conflict.

Constraint variants are ubiquitous: implementing them requires considerable (if not prohibitive) effort and decreases maintainability, but will deliver better performance.   This paper shows how to use variable views, previously introduced for an implementation architecture, to derive perfect propagator variants. A model for views and derived propagators is introduced. Derived propagators are proved to be indeed perfect in that they inherit essential properties such as correctness and domain and bounds consistency. Techniques for systematically deriving propagators such as transformation, generalization, specialization, and channeling are developed for several variable domains. We evaluate the massive impact of derived propagators. Without derived propagators, Gecode would require 140000 rather than 40000 lines of code for propagators."

The composition of Smodels program modules is suitably limited by module conditions which ensure the compatibility of the module system with stable models. Hence the semantics of an entire Smodels program depends directly on stable models assigned to its modules. This result is formalized as a module theorem which truly strengthens Lifschitz and Turner's splitting-set theorem for the class of Smodels programs. To streamline generalizations in the future, the module theorem is first proved for normal programs and then extended to cover Smodels programs using a translation from the latter class of programs to the former class. Moreover, the respective notion of module-level equivalence, namely modular equivalence, is shown to be a proper congruence relation: it is preserved under substitutions of modules that are modularly equivalent. Principles for program decomposition are also addressed. The strongly connected components of the respective dependency graph can be exploited in order to extract a module structure when there is no explicit a priori knowledge about the modules of a program. The paper includes a practical demonstration of tools that have been developed for automated (de)composition of Smodels programs.   To appear in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming."

We propose a new probabilistically-derived measure, independent of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated measures to gather linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical evidence from Google search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our comparative study using 1,825 test cases against an existing empirically-derived function revealed an improvement in terms of precision, recall and accuracy."

    "abstract": "Most works related to unithood were conducted as part of a larger effort for the determination of termhood. Consequently, the number of independent research that study the notion of unithood and produce dedicated techniques for measuring unithood is extremely small. We propose a new approach, independent of any influences of termhood, that provides dedicated measures to gather linguistic evidence from parsed text and statistical evidence from Google search engine for the measurement of unithood. Our evaluations revealed a precision and recall of 98.68% and 91.82% respectively with an accuracy at 95.42% in measuring the unithood of 1005 test cases."

    "title": "Enhanced Integrated Scoring for Cleaning Dirty Texts",
    "abstract": "An increasing number of approaches for ontology engineering from text are gearing towards the use of online sources such as company intranet and the World Wide Web. Despite such rise, not much work can be found in aspects of preprocessing and cleaning dirty texts from online sources. This paper presents an enhancement of an Integrated Scoring for Spelling error correction, Abbreviation expansion and Case restoration (ISSAC). ISSAC is implemented as part of a text preprocessing phase in an ontology engineering system. New evaluations performed on the enhanced ISSAC using 700 chat records reveal an improved accuracy of 98% as compared to 96.5% and 71% based on the use of only basic ISSAC and of Aspell, respectively."

    "abstract": "We present a domain-independent algorithm that computes macros in a novel way. Our algorithm computes macros \"on-the-fly\" for a given set of states and does not require previously learned or inferred information, nor prior domain knowledge. The algorithm is used to define new domain-independent tractable classes of classical planning that are proved to include \\emph{Blocksworld-arm} and \\emph{Towers of Hanoi}."

    "abstract": "In this study, we reproduce two new hybrid intelligent systems, involve three prominent intelligent computing and approximate reasoning methods: Self Organizing feature Map (SOM), Neruo-Fuzzy Inference System and Rough Set Theory (RST),called SONFIS and SORST. We show how our algorithms can be construed as a linkage of government-society interactions, where government catches various states of behaviors: solid (absolute) or flexible. So, transition of society, by changing of connectivity parameters (noise) from order to disorder is inferred."

    "title": "Relationship between Diversity and Perfomance of Multiple Classifiers for Decision Support",
    "abstract": "The paper presents the investigation and implementation of the relationship between diversity and the performance of multiple classifiers on classification accuracy. The study is critical as to build classifiers that are strong and can generalize better. The parameters of the neural network within the committee were varied to induce diversity; hence structural diversity is the focus for this study. The hidden nodes and the activation function are the parameters that were varied. The diversity measures that were adopted from ecology such as Shannon and Simpson were used to quantify diversity. Genetic algorithm is used to find the optimal ensemble by using the accuracy as the cost function. The results observed shows that there is a relationship between structural diversity and accuracy. It is observed that the classification accuracy of an ensemble increases as the diversity increases. There was an increase of 3%-6% in the classification accuracy."

    "abstract": "The paper presents an exponential pheromone deposition rule to modify the basic ant system algorithm which employs constant deposition rule. A stability analysis using differential equation is carried out to find out the values of parameters that make the ant system dynamics stable for both kinds of deposition rule. A roadmap of connected cities is chosen as the problem environment where the shortest route between two given cities is required to be discovered. Simulations performed with both forms of deposition approach using Elitist Ant System model reveal that the exponential deposition approach outperforms the classical one by a large extent. Exhaustive experiments are also carried out to find out the optimum setting of different controlling parameters for exponential deposition approach and an empirical relationship between the major controlling parameters of the algorithm and some features of problem environment."
